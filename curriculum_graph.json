Structure", "id": "chunk_25"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The English curriculum is presented in curriculum levels from Foundation to Level 10. Content is organised under 3 interrelated strands: Language Literature Literacy.", "id": "chunk_26"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Each strand is organised by sub-strands. Sub-strands group content descriptions under an appropriate concept, to provide both a focus and a clear sequence for the development of related concepts and skills within strands and across levels. Language strand In the Language strand, students develop their knowledge of the English language and how it works. They learn how language enables people to interact effectively, build and maintain relationships, and express and exchange knowledge, skills, attitudes, emotions and opinions. They explore language across all language modes, engaging with spoken language as the foundation of learning and an essential component of exploring ideas, expressing viewpoints, forming arguments and building vocabulary. Students also explore how language operates within a contextual framework, in which choices vary according to topic, purpose and audience. They discover the patterns and purposes of English usage, including spelling, grammar and punctuation at the levels of the word, sentence and extended text. By acquiring a body of knowledge about these patterns and their connections, students learn to communicate effectively through coherent, well-structured sentences and texts. They develop a consistent way of understanding and talking about language: language in use and language as a system. This enables them to reflect on their own speaking and writing, and to discuss these productively with others. This strand informs teaching and learning activities and connects to key concepts and skills in the other strands. The Language strand has 3 sub-strands. Language for interacting with others Students learn that language varies according to relationships, social setting, purpose and audience, and is a means for expressing personal and social identity. Text structure and organisation Students learn how texts are structured for different audiences and contexts, and to achieve particular purposes. They learn the techniques that authors use to guide and influence the reader or viewer through effective use of resources at the levels of the word, sentence and extended text. Language for expressing and developing ideas Students learn how to control and use a range of clause structures and word groups as well as combinations of sound, image, movement and layout. They build vocabulary and learn how to understand and use words according to context. Literature strand The Literature strand engages students in the study of literary texts of personal, cultural, social and aesthetic value. These texts include works that are recognised as having enduring social and artistic value, some of which may be referred to as classic or canonical texts, and some that attract contemporary attention. Literature is a dynamic and evolving body of work comprising texts (written, spoken, visual, multimodal, print and digital) from diverse historical and cultural contexts. These texts are valued and appreciated for their form and style, and their contribution to cultural, historical and social understanding. Learning to appreciate literary texts and to create their own texts that draw from literature enriches students\u2019 understanding of the breadth and complexity of human experiences. It builds students\u2019 knowledge of the interrelationship between language and culture, and stimulates creative and critical thinking. Students appreciate, analyse, interpret and evaluate a range of literary texts. This range includes the oral narrative traditions and literature of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, classic and contemporary literature from a wide range of Australian authors, and world literature including texts from and about Asia. Students create texts such as short stories, poetry, plays and short films. The Literature strand has 4 sub-strands. Literature and contexts Students learn how characters, events, perspectives and issues in literary texts are shaped by the historical, cultural and social contexts in which they were created. Engaging with and responding to literature Students learn to respond personally to literary texts and make connections to their own lives, other texts and the responses of others. Examining literature Students learn how to explain, analyse and evaluate the ways in which stories, characters, ideas, experiences, opinions and contexts are reflected in texts. They learn to compare and appraise the ways that authors use language and literary devices to influence readers. They also learn to understand, evaluate, interpret and discuss how certain stylistic choices can create multiple layers of interpretation and effect. Creating literature Students learn how to use personal knowledge and literary texts as starting points to create their own texts. They create texts with imaginative and literary qualities in different genres and forms, and for particular audiences. Using print and digital texts, students develop skills that allow them to convey meaning, address significant issues, and heighten engagement and impact. Literacy strand In the Literacy strand, students make meaning through application of skills and knowledge from the Language strand. They develop their ability to interpret and create texts with appropriateness, accuracy, confidence, fluency and efficacy for learning, both in and out of school. This ability helps them to participate in Australian life more generally. When they begin to read and write, they learn the sound (phonemes) and letter (graphemes) correspondences of English and how these combine. Students learn to adapt language to meet the demands of general or specialised purposes, audiences and contexts. They learn about the different ways in which knowledge and opinion are represented and developed in texts. They learn that varying degrees of abstraction and complexity can be shown through language and multimodal representations. Texts chosen include media texts, everyday texts and workplace texts from increasingly complex and unfamiliar settings. Texts are composed using language ranging from the everyday language of personal experience to more abstract, specialised and technical language, including the language of schooling and academic study. Students engage with print and digital texts, and develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, viewing and writing systematically and concurrently. The Literacy strand has 6 sub-strands. Interacting with others Students learn how language is used to express ideas, arguments and opinions in spoken and written presentations by selecting and using linguistic and multimodal elements. Phonic and word knowledge Students develop knowledge about the sounds of English (phonemes) and learn to identify the sounds in spoken words. They learn the letters of the alphabet and how to write words using combinations of these letters. They apply their knowledge of phonemes and graphemes to decode words. Students learn that patterns and generalisations relate to the spelling of words in English. They learn to apply phonic knowledge to decode text, especially from Foundation to Level 2. From Level 7, this sub-strand is called Word knowledge to reflect the fact that students have progressed beyond phonic development. Building fluency and making meaning Students build and develop decoding and text processing skills and strategies to read with increasing automaticity and for meaning. This sub-strand ends after Level 6 to reflect the fact that from Level 7 students have consolidated the skills of reading fluently. Texts in context Students learn that texts are influenced by historical and cultural contexts, and particular purposes and audiences. Analysing, interpreting and evaluating Students learn to apply text processing skills and strategies to navigate increasingly complex texts. Students learn to comprehend what they read and view. They develop more sophisticated processes for interpreting, analysing, evaluating and critiquing ideas, information and issues from different sources. Students explore how conventions and structures are used in written, digital and multimedia texts. They use their growing knowledge of text structures, language and visual features, and literary devices to explain how texts influence different audiences. Creating texts Students apply knowledge and skills they have developed in other strands and sub-strands to create spoken, written and multimodal texts. They create these texts with clarity, authority and novelty, by selecting key aspects of a topic as well as language and multimodal features. As part of the process of creating texts, students learn to edit for meaning and enhanced effect. They develop and consolidate a handwriting style that is legible, fluent and automatic, and that supports sustained writing.", "id": "chunk_27"}, {"type": "Section", "id": "Achievement Standard"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards", "id": "chunk_28"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards describe what students are typically able to understand and do, and they are the basis for reporting student achievement.", "id": "chunk_29"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In English, students progress along a learning continuum that provides the first achievement standard at Foundation and then at Levels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.", "id": "chunk_30"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Content descriptions", "id": "chunk_31"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In English, content descriptions sequence and describe the knowledge, understanding and skills that teachers need to teach and students are expected to learn.

When learning is recursive, engaging with an appropriate range of different types of texts that increase in complexity and challenge as students move through the curriculum levels is critical. Learning across the strands Students develop knowledge, understanding and skills across the strands of Language, Literature and Literacy. Each strand contributes its own distinctive goals, body of knowledge, history of ideas and interests to the study of English. However, while each strand comprises a discrete set of knowledge and skills, there are significant and important connections. Identifying and developing these interconnections and enacting them through teaching and learning will offer rich opportunities for students to develop their understandings.

These approaches draw attention to the ways in which languages change, and to the distinction between language in use and language as a system. These approaches also acknowledge that students\u2019 ability to use grammar will exceed their ability to explicitly reflect on grammar. Young children, for example, will use complex sentences before they can explain how these are structured.", "id": "chunk_38"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "These approaches, in describing language, also pay attention to both the structure (syntax) and meaning (semantics) at the word, sentence and extended text levels. The English curriculum uses standard grammatical terminology within a contextual framework, in which language choices are seen to vary according to the topics at hand, the nature and proximity of the relationships between the language users, and the modalities or channels of communication available. Through the study of different social and geographical dialects, students can explore the many English language varieties spoken in Australia, including Aboriginal English, and learn that these languages may have different writing systems and oral traditions. The place of literature The Literature strand gives students the opportunity to study the processes by which certain literary works become recognised, and to understand why most cultures have works they cherish.", "id": "chunk_39"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "There are many approaches to the study of literature. In the English curriculum, those drawn on most substantially include: close reading to develop a critical understanding and appreciation of the aesthetics and intellectual aspects of texts cultural studies, with emphasis on the different ways in which literature is significant in everyday life structuralism, with its emphasis on close analysis of literary works and the key ideas on which they are based, for example the detailed stylistic study of differing styles of literary work comparativism, with its emphasis on comparisons of works of literature from different language, ethnic and cultural backgrounds historicism, with its emphasis on exploring the relationships between historical, cultural and literary traditions. The study of texts Texts can be written, spoken or multimodal, and in print or digital forms. Multimodal texts combine language with other means of communication such as visual images, soundtrack or spoken word, as in film or digital media. Texts provide important opportunities for learning about aspects of human experience and about aesthetic value. Many of the tasks that students undertake in and out of school involve understanding and producing narrative, informative and persuasive texts, media texts, everyday texts and workplace texts. Texts are drawn from world and Australian literature. They include the oral narrative traditions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, texts from Asia, texts from Australia\u2019s immigrant cultures and texts of students\u2019 choice. Literature refers to past and present texts from a range of cultural contexts that are valued for their form and style and are recognised as having enduring or artistic value. While the nature of what constitutes literary texts is dynamic and evolving, they are seen as having personal, social, cultural and aesthetic value and potential for enriching students\u2019 scope of experience. Literature includes a broad range of forms such as novels, poetry, short stories and plays, fiction for young adults and children, multimodal texts such as film, and a variety of non-fiction. Literary texts also include excerpts from longer texts. This enables a range of literary texts to be included within any one level for close study or comparative purposes. Through the selection of appropriate texts, students develop an awareness and appreciation of, and respect for, the literature of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, including storytelling traditions (oral narrative) as well as contemporary literature. Students develop understandings of the historical, cultural and social contexts associated with different uses of language and textual features. Literacy in English The Literacy strand includes a focus on: fluency in the sound\u2013letter correspondences of English an expanding reading, writing and speaking vocabulary and an understanding of grammatical and textual patterns to enable learning from texts encountered in and out of school, and to create effective and innovative texts fluency and innovation in reading, viewing and creating texts in different settings the skill and disposition needed to analyse and understand the philosophical, moral, political and aesthetic bases on which many texts are built expanding the range of materials listened to, viewed and read, and experimenting with innovative ways of expressing increasingly subtle and complex ideas through texts.", "id": "chunk_40"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Curriculum", "id": "chunk_41"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Foundation Level description", "id": "chunk_42"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The English curriculum is organised under 3 interrelated strands: Language, Literature and Literacy.

Dance is expressive movement with purpose and form. Early sensory experiences through play and playful dance are fundamental to students\u2019 learning in Dance and to the development of kinaesthetic and discipline knowledge. Through Dance, students explore the elements of dance, skills, techniques and processes. They question and celebrate human experience, using the body as the instrument and movement as the medium for personal, social, emotional, spiritual, cultural and physical communication. For children in the early years, Dance is play and playful movement. Like all art forms, dance has the capacity to engage, inspire and enrich all students and excite the imagination. Learning in Dance is inclusive and encourages students of all abilities to reach their creative and expressive potential. Dance develops students\u2019 creativity, imagination, aesthetic knowledge, collaborative skills, communication, confidence, curiosity, problem-solving skills and self-expression. In Dance, students draw on a diverse range of experiences, sources and ideas for creating dances. Students use the elements of dance to explore and practise technical and expressive skills for choreography and presentation to an audience. As they learn in Dance, students develop a movement vocabulary with which to explore and refine ways of moving both individually and collaboratively. They learn to choreograph, present, perform and appreciate as they engage with dance practices and practitioners from their own and others\u2019 cultures and communities. Dance as an art form enhances students\u2019 knowledge and understanding of diverse cultures, times and places, developing their personal, social and cultural identity. Dance is a central element in the diversity and continuity of local and global cultures, particularly the cultures of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. Through Dance, students develop an understanding of how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples express connection to and responsibility for Country and Place.

Dance comprises 4 interrelated strands: Exploring Developing Practices Creating Presenting. Exploring In this strand, students learn as artists and audiences. They explore: movement and dance ideas, practices and works cultures, times, places and other contexts in which dance occurs dance works and the ways in which they are presented and performed the diversity and significance of storytelling and dance for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples\u2019 cultures and communities how dance communicates cultural and aesthetic knowledge, ideas and purposes how dance develops understanding of multiple perspectives how to reflect and respond to their explorations using the language of movement and terminology associated with dance. Developing Practices In this strand, students develop practices and skills in dance. Initially these practices and skills are achieved through play and imagination. Students: learn about and develop their understanding of the elements of dance (body, time, space and energy), movement categories and expressive, technical and performance skills learn about and develop skills in choreography as the main creative process for making dance learn about the role of music in dance shape their dance ideas using processes such as improvising, exploring, reimagining, selecting and structuring movement to communicate their intentions develop practices associated with production elements such as costume, props, set, sound, lighting, make-up and technologies develop skills to critically observe, reflect, respond, analyse and evaluate their own and others\u2019 practices in dance using the language of movement and terminology relevant to dance develop skills in safe, inclusive and sustainable dance practices including appropriate use of the body, performance space, technologies, production elements and inclusion of others. Creating In this strand, students are positioned as artists. As artists, students: use the elements of dance, expressive and performance skills, and movement categories to make and create dance works as individuals and in groups use choreographic processes to create original, devised dance, or interpretations of others\u2019 dances consider and select music and sound create dances that may be work in progress or may be rehearsed, refined and realised for presentation, in both formal and informal settings, to an audience observe, critically reflect on and respond to their own and others\u2019 creative practice using the language of movement and terminology relevant to dance use safe dance practices. Presenting In this strand, students as dancers share work and ideas with audiences in ways that are safe, inclusive and appropriate to the work and its intentions. Presenting includes performance and considers: how students plan, select, choreograph and rehearse audiences as real or virtual, small or large, peers or invited and intentional audiences presenting or performing dances in and for diverse spaces use of additional materials and technologies such as the production elements of costume, props, set, sound, music, lighting, make-up and technologies the process of reflecting on and documenting their responses to their own and others\u2019 dance works using dance terminology use of safe dance practices.", "id": "chunk_135"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards", "id": "chunk_136"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards describe what students are typically able to understand and do, and they are the basis for reporting student achievement.", "id": "chunk_137"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Dance, students progress along a learning continuum that provides the first achievement standard at Foundation, and then at Levels 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.", "id": "chunk_138"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Content descriptions", "id": "chunk_139"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Dance, content descriptions sequence and describe the knowledge, understanding and skills that teachers need to teach and students are expected to learn.

Elements are the foundational building blocks of knowledge and skills in dance. The elements of dance are: body time space energy. The elements of dance work dynamically together to create and communicate ideas and intentions through dance to audiences. Other dance terminology may be included, particularly at Levels 9 and 10, for example elements of dance to align with senior secondary courses. Types of dance", "id": "chunk_141"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In the Dance curriculum, students learn about dance from a range of cultures, times, places and other contexts. They explore, choreograph and perform dances that are drawn from diverse styles and forms that are representative of the 3 main types of dance: dance created/choreographed to be performed to an audience (for example, forms of theatrical dance such as ballet, tap and jazz; exhibition dance such as ballroom dance; local dance traditions, storytelling dance, dances that depict traditional practices and folk dance; and dance choreographed for screen-based works such as films or games) participatory dance for personal and social purposes not intended for a broader audience (for example, dance for exercise, social dance styles, dance crazes or novelty dances) dance performed or participated in for a specific purpose such as spiritual devotion or ceremonial rites (for example, dance in traditional celebrations or festivals or as part of a cultural ceremony such as a wedding). Viewpoints Throughout their Dance learning, students use questions based on viewpoints as an inquiry tool for considering their own and others\u2019 use of ideas and concepts from multiple perspectives. Students can use questions based on viewpoints to: structure their reasoning and reflecting explore ideas and make decisions explore and develop empathy for multiple perspectives express and celebrate identities, ideas and meaning think deeply about their own dance practices and about dance works they experience that are created by others. As they create and respond to dances and experiences, students develop questions to explore ideas, perspectives and meaning. They think and make decisions as artists and as audiences. Questions based on viewpoints encourage students to consider a range of perspectives and to think deeply about their own dance and the dances created by others. Contexts The context of a dance work is the frame of reference that allows its meaning to be interpreted. Interpretation of the meaning of a dance work can evolve from the context in which it is created, and the location and time in which the dance is presented or viewed. Contexts can also be the economic, philosophical, historical, social or cultural influences on the practices of the artist, the artist\u2019s intentions, and the intended communication of ideas, values and beliefs. Artists In dance, artists include dancers, choreographers, producers, dance notators and other creative practitioners who work in dance contexts to create dance, tell stories and explore artistic, social, political and cultural themes and ideas through movement. In dance, artists work individually and collaboratively using historical and contemporary styles and choreographic processes to create dances. Students investigate the practices and dance works of artists working in diverse forms across cultures, times, places and other contexts, including the works of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Safe dance practice Safe dance practice encourages and promotes physical health and emotional wellbeing. It includes physical and psychological dimensions and should be applied at all times in Dance learning. Safe dance practice includes warming up and cooling down the body, wearing clothing that enables the body to move freely, awareness of bodies and objects in a dance space, and the creation of safe and collaborative spaces for students to feel included. Materials and technologies Movement is the essential material of dance. Movement begins with the body and body awareness, including the use of body bases, body parts and body zones. The body uses movement vocabulary developed by using the elements of dance to express and give form to feelings and ideas in choreography and performance. Additional materials and technologies can be applied. In dance, additional materials enable: creation of setting(s); for example, using open-ended materials such as recycled materials, lengths of paper, and large and small boxes to create or represent a space communication of place; for example, using a length of material to represent a river, or specific set pieces to move around and interact with communication of a character within a dance; for example, using a costume item or prop symbolism and representation; for example, using coloured fabric or rostra blocks of various heights to enable levels and indicate power and status communication of time; for example, using props and costumes to indicate the period of the performance or dance style. In dance, technologies enable: on-screen viewing of live or recorded dance from diverse cultures, times and places to broaden awareness of the possibilities of the art form or to support dance ideas and processes of analysis stimulus prior to developing dances using screen-based images, sound or music using technologies and online platforms to assist with production and production elements reflection on, evaluation of or refinement of work in progress; for example, using video of a rehearsal to consider refinements and next steps in the dance use of available devices to support reflection and responding; for example, capturing a gesture or travel sequence and asking students (as audience) to reflect on whether the intended meaning is being communicated use of projections (text or still/moving image) to contribute to or juxtapose with live action to enhance the meaning in a dance use of lighting (including torches or handheld LED lights) use of sound and music, including recorded sound and music, to create and manipulate mood or atmosphere and to support the dancer.", "id": "chunk_142"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Curriculum", "id": "chunk_143"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Foundation Level description", "id": "chunk_144"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Foundation, learning in Dance builds on the Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Framework and each student\u2019s prior learning and experiences.

As a discipline within the arts, drama responds to our need to share and enact stories, and to create and make meaning across cultures, times, places and other contexts. Drama is an inclusive art form, one that is accessible to all, engaging students as they learn about themselves, their peers and the world. For children in Foundation to Level 2, drama is play and playful storytelling. Drama involves unique discipline knowledge, skills, capabilities and creative processes. It develops students\u2019 creativity, imagination, criticality, aesthetic knowledge, collaborative skills, communication, confidence, curiosity, problem-solving skills and self-expression. Learning in Drama involves a range of distinct processes including storytelling, devising, writing, rehearsing, designing, presenting, performing, reflecting, analysing and evaluating. Drama as a discipline has a unique language and set of terminology that enables students to engage with historical and contemporary theatre practices and theatre design, and build critical knowledge in relation to acting, direction, costume, set, props, make-up, sound, lighting and technologies. Drama includes theatre and theatre-making as students progress in their learning. In Drama, students draw on a diverse range of experiences, sources and ideas for creating stories and making dramatic works. Through Drama, students develop their ability to empathise, think creatively and critically, and understand a range of perspectives through role, character and storytelling. In Drama, students learn how creative industries such as theatre-making contribute to culture, community and economic wellbeing. Drama as an art form is central to the diversity and continuity of local and global cultures, particularly the cultures of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples.\u202fThrough drama, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples create, celebrate and express connection to and responsibility for Country and Place. Learning in Drama deepens students\u2019 understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples\u2019 connection to and responsibility for Country and Place.

Drama comprises 4 interrelated strands: Exploring Developing Practices Creating Presenting. Exploring In this strand, students learn as artists and as audiences. They explore: drama ideas, practices, styles and forms across the diverse cultures, times, places and other contexts in which drama occurs drama works and the ways in which they are presented and performed the diversity and significance of storytelling and drama for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples' cultures and communities how drama and theatre communicate cultural and aesthetic knowledge, ideas and purposes how drama develops empathy and understanding of multiple perspectives. Students observe, reflect and respond to their explorations using the elements of drama, materials, imagery, sound, movement, language and/or digital tools. Developing Practices In this strand, students develop practices and skills in drama. Initially these practices and skills are achieved through play and imagination. Students: learn about and develop their understanding of the elements of drama, expressive skills and performance skills essential to drama develop practices associated with theatre design areas such as costume, props, set, sound, lighting, make-up and technologies develop skills to critically observe, reflect on, respond to, analyse and evaluate their own and others\u2019 practices in drama develop skills in safe, inclusive and sustainable drama practices including appropriate use of technologies, design areas and inclusion of others. Creating In this strand, students are positioned as artists. As artists, students: use the elements of drama, expressive skills and performance skills to make and create dramatic works as individuals and in groups create original, devised works or interpretations of others\u2019 work by exploring scripts and applying areas of design and technology create drama that may be work in progress or may be rehearsed, refined and realised for presentation, in both formal and informal settings, to an audience observe, critically reflect on and respond to their own and others\u2019 creative practice. Presenting In this strand, students as artists share work and ideas with audiences in ways that are safe, inclusive and appropriate to the dramatic work and its intentions. Presenting includes performance and considers: audiences as real or virtual, small or large, peers or an invited and intentional audience drama presented in a diversity of spaces use of additional materials and technologies such as the design areas of costume, props, set, sound, lighting, make-up and technologies reflection on and documentation of their responses to their own and others\u2019 work.", "id": "chunk_196"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards", "id": "chunk_197"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards describe what students are typically able to understand and do, and they are the basis for reporting student achievement.", "id": "chunk_198"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Drama, students progress along a learning continuum that provides the first achievement standard at Foundation, and then at Levels 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.", "id": "chunk_199"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Content descriptions", "id": "chunk_200"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Drama, content descriptions sequence and describe the knowledge, understanding and skills that teachers need to teach and students are expected to learn.

The elements are: character and relationships climax conflict context/setting contrast dramatic meaning mood sound space and time symbol tension. The elements of drama work dynamically together to create dramatic action and convey meaning to an audience. Other elements of drama may be included, particularly at Levels 9 and 10, for example elements to align with senior secondary courses. Expressive and performance skills In Drama, students also explore, develop and refine their expressive and performance skills. In Drama, these are: actor\u2013audience relationship energy focus facial expression gesture movement stillness and silence voice. Styles and conventions In Drama, students learn about different theatre styles and dramatic forms from a range of cultures, times, places and other contexts. These may include the styles of comedy, tragedy, mime, physical theatre, realism, puppetry, musical theatre, melodrama, verbatim theatre, magic realism, kabuki and the works of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. They explore different theatre styles and dramatic form through researching, improvising, devising or working with scripts written by playwrights. Viewpoints Throughout their Drama learning, students use questions based on viewpoints as an inquiry tool for considering their own and others\u2019 use of ideas and concepts from multiple perspectives. Students can use questions based on viewpoints to: structure their reasoning and reflecting explore ideas and make decisions explore and develop empathy for multiple perspectives express and celebrate identities, ideas and meaning think deeply about their own drama practices and about drama works they experience that are created by others. As they create and respond to drama works and experiences, students develop questions to explore ideas, perspectives and meaning. They think and make decisions as artists and as audiences. Questions based on viewpoints encourage students to consider a range of perspectives and to think deeply about their own drama and the drama created by others. Contexts The context of a dramatic work is the frame of reference that allows its meaning to be interpreted. Interpretation of the meaning of a dramatic work can evolve from the context in which it is created, and the location and time in which it is presented or viewed. Contexts can also be the economic, philosophical, historical, social or cultural influences on the practices of the artist, the artist\u2019s intentions, and the intended communication of ideas, values and beliefs. Artists In drama, artists include playwrights, actors, directors, designers and those who devise new drama and theatre work to tell stories and explore artistic, social, political and cultural themes and ideas. In drama, artists work individually and collaboratively using diverse drama practices (including historical and contemporary practices) to create drama and theatre. Students investigate the practices and dramatic works of artists working in diverse forms across cultures, times, places and other contexts. Students learn as artists as they develop their own drama and theatre practices. Materials and technologies In Drama, materials enable the creation of setting(s) for dramatic play, communication of place, communication of character and symbolism and relationships. Materials and technologies in Drama may include specific or open-ended materials such as boxes, buttons, recycled materials, found objects, lengths of material, specific set pieces, costume items, props and the use of colours. In Drama, technologies enable students to view live or recorded theatre for analysis and as inspiration and stimulus for their own making; learn about theatre styles; engage with digital platforms to collaborate as a production team; provide ways to document and reflect on their own work; capture their work in drama; use theatre lighting or hand-held lighting to enhance presentations and performance; and record sound and sound effects.", "id": "chunk_202"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Curriculum", "id": "chunk_203"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Foundation Level description", "id": "chunk_204"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Foundation, learning in Drama builds on the Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Framework (VEYLDF) and each student\u2019s prior learning and experiences.

Media Arts explores concepts and perspectives, and examines, interprets and analyses media practices that represent the world from diverse perspectives. Media artists work collaboratively and use traditional and emerging media technologies and creative processes to plan, produce and distribute media arts works. Through the creative use of materials and technologies to convey meaning, students create and manipulate still and moving images, text, sound and interactive elements. They construct representations and communicate or challenge understandings, ideas and positions. Media arts plays an important role in sustaining cultural diversity and continuing local, national and global cultures, particularly the cultures of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. It offers opportunities to use media platforms to celebrate, maintain or revitalise ways of knowing, being, doing, belonging and becoming. Through media arts, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples celebrate and express connection to and responsibility for Country and Place.", "id": "chunk_254"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The Media Arts curriculum recognises that media forms can operate at either a mass level or at an interpersonal level, where communication occurs between individuals and among online communities.

Media Arts comprises 4 interrelated strands: Exploring Developing Practices Creating Presenting. Exploring In this strand, students learn as artists and as audiences. They explore: media arts works and media contexts in the lives of individuals and groups across cultures, times, places and other contexts the diversity of how, where and why people create, make, distribute and respond to media arts works the diversity and significance of media arts for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, cultures and communities how media arts works communicate cultural and aesthetic knowledge, purpose, meaning and emotion how media arts develops empathy and understanding of multiple perspectives and viewpoints. Students respond using media arts practices and forms, images, sounds, movement, language and/or digital tools. Developing Practices In this strand, students develop practices and skills for producing and responding to media arts. Students develop skills through experimentation\u202fand creative and critical thinking. They develop creative and critical practices, including: creative skills and confidence to imagine, use and manipulate visual and aural elements, media languages and technologies to create representations that communicate stories, narratives, ideas and meaning safe and ethical use of production processes using available resources critical skills in observing, reflecting, analysing and evaluating their own and others\u2019 media arts practices, using language/terminology and embodied practices. Creating In this strand, as artists, students apply media arts and production processes. As audiences, they reflect on their work as it develops, for example through observation, analysis, reflection, evaluation and considering the relationships their work creates with audiences. Students use media arts concepts and production processes to construct representations and produce media arts works in a range of forms, styles and/or genres. Presenting In this strand, students share (exhibit, screen, publish or distribute) their media arts works using spaces and resources. Students may also work collaboratively to produce media arts works. Students: plan and design their presentations, considering audiences and institutional practices share\u202ftheir work using materials and technologies observe\u202fand, as appropriate, engage and participate\u202fin interactions with media arts works and audiences.", "id": "chunk_257"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards", "id": "chunk_258"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards describe what students are typically able to understand and do, and they are the basis for reporting student achievement.", "id": "chunk_259"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Media Arts, students progress along a learning continuum that provides the first achievement standard at Foundation, and then at Levels 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.", "id": "chunk_260"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Content descriptions", "id": "chunk_261"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Media Arts, content descriptions sequence and describe the knowledge, understanding and skills that teachers need to teach and students are expected to learn.

Learning in Media Arts Media arts practices In Media Arts, students engage with technologies and interdisciplinary art forms to design, produce, distribute and interact with a range of print, audio, screen-based or hybrid artworks. Students explore, view, analyse and participate in media culture from a range of perspectives and in a variety of contexts. They acquire the knowledge and skills to work in a range of media forms and styles. Students learn to reflect critically on their own and others\u2019 media arts experiences and evaluate media arts works from different cultures, times, places and other contexts including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures. They express, conceptualise and communicate through their media arts works using creative and critical use of language and technologies with increasing complexity and aesthetic understanding. Media arts concepts There are 7 concepts fundamental to media arts. They are: media technologies representations audiences institutions media languages viewpoints contexts. Together, the media arts concepts provide a framework for students to engage with and create media arts works in existing or emerging forms and to consider media arts practices. The media arts concepts, although discussed independently, are interrelated. Students engage with each of the concepts at varying levels of depth in all levels. Media technologies Media technologies are integral to media arts practices. Students: use a range of available digital and analog tools as they create and respond produce media arts works using available and appropriate technology and reflect on the making of their media arts works reflect critically on developments across media technologies and consider responsible and ethical media practices and how media arts are used for diverse purposes across cultures, times, places and other contexts. Representations Representations are present in all media arts works. All media arts works are constructed through narratives and media artists build representations of people, places, concepts, themes and events through the stories they tell. Students: examine the construction of representations in narratives in media arts works and build their own reflect critically on the impact of repeated representations and how they change over time and across contexts consider the ways people learn with and from others through viewpoints, values and attitudes embedded in representations in media arts works. Audiences All media products are distributed to audiences, who consume them in different ways. Factors such as technology, media literacy and the context of creation and consumption can all alter the way audiences receive, engage with and respond to media products. All media products are made for target audiences, defined by their cultural, social and historical context, demographics such as age and gender, and individual traits such as values. A media product may be considered successful if the intended audiences receive, engage with and respond to the product the way the media creator intended. A consideration of audience is a critical aspect of media arts practice. Students: consider the audience(s) that media arts works are made for (target audience), how audiences might interpret the work and differences in interpretations across audiences examine how audiences come together or can be polarised. Institutions Media institutions include broadcasting companies; print and digital newspaper and magazine publishers; film, television and screen and music production companies; and other production and publishing companies. Media institutions can be local, national or global and owned or controlled by individuals, corporations or governments. The diversity of media institutions is evolving and dynamic. Students: explore how individuals, communities, organisations and institutions engage in practices that influence media production for economic, political or social gain investigate how media arts works are distributed (shared with audiences) consider their own engagement with media explore responsible media practice, ethical implications of media practices and ways they are influenced by media institutions. Media languages Media languages include the still and/or moving images, sounds and texts used to tell a story. Students develop knowledge and use of the language of media in terms of design, production, distribution, consumption, engagement with, reception, reading and critique of their and others\u2019 media products. They also examine the terms used by media practitioners and institutions. Meaning is created through the use of media codes and media conventions. Media codes and media conventions combine to create a media product and should be seen as working together. Media codes Technical, written and symbolic codes have a physical presence in media forms and products and are used to create, construct and suggest meaning. Media codes include camera, lighting, mise en scene, editing, sound, acting, layout, typography, text and images among other things. Codes construct the media form and product. Media conventions The elements that create and shape meaning in a media form or product. They include story structure, story principles, genre conventions, character, cause and effect, and point of view. Conventions tend to remain the same across mediums but also refer to the following: Genre conventions: The rules that define genres based on the cultural assumptions about the significance of media products, the type of audiences who consume media products and practices of the media industries. Narrative conventions: Common narrative structures, such as character, character arcs and three-act structures. Viewpoints Throughout their Media Arts learning, students use questions based on viewpoints as an inquiry tool for considering their own and others\u2019 use of media arts concepts from multiple perspectives. Students can use questions based on viewpoints to: structure their reasoning and reflecting explore ideas and make decisions explore and develop empathy for multiple perspectives express and celebrate identities, ideas and meaning think deeply about their own media arts practices and media arts works by others that they experience. As they create and respond to media arts works and experiences, students develop questions to explore ideas, perspectives and meaning. They think and make decisions as artists and as audiences. Questions based on viewpoints encourage students to consider a range of perspectives and to think deeply about their own and others' media arts works. Contexts All media arts practices are embedded in the context of the time and place in which they were created and viewed. In Media Arts, students explore and reflect on: the contexts of media forms the ways people learn with and from others through the media their own motivations the relationships they hope to build with audiences the context in which they create media products how online and mobile platforms are developing and the impact this is having on production and distribution practices, and how they construct their relationships with audiences to engage them on platforms the relationships they develop with various media forms as audience. Media arts forms Media arts forms refer to the technological means and channels by which the media is created, produced, distributed, consumed and read. Media arts forms can include: moving image, such as film, television, video or animation still image, such as narrative photography audio, such as radio or podcasts print, such as magazines, zines, comics, graphic novels, newspapers or posters digital, such as online video and audio, streaming video and audio, podcasts, magazines, comics, graphic novels, newspapers, video games, blogs, websites or apps convergent or hybridised media, which is the combination or joining of 2 or more media forms, such as photography and animation, print productions and a digital game, or augmented and virtual reality products. Media production process There are 5 key stages of the media production process to create media arts works. Development Development involves exploring the ideas, intentions, narrative and audience of a production. Students: research other media products, analysing codes and conventions, narrative, genre or style and may consider the context of a product investigate equipment, materials and technologies in a range of media forms relevant to their audience and intention. Pre-production Pre-production planning considers the concept, audience, intention, narrative and context of a media product. Pre-production involves planning a narrative, including how it will engage and be consumed and read by an audience. Media codes and conventions, genre and style are considered in the construction of the narrative. Documentation and planning may take visual and written forms, such as production notes or storyboards. Media practitioners may undertake technical tests and experiments prior to production, reflecting on their success or failure. Production Production is when a product is captured or recorded. Production may be a collaborative process involving a number of people with specific roles or it may be an individual process. Reflection and evaluation of the production can occur through written documentation, oral feedback and visual feedback. Post-production Productions are refined during post-production, considering the intention, audience and planned narrative. Codes and conventions are used to resolve ideas and engage audiences. Specific equipment and technologies are used in editing. Feedback is sought and the creator and audiences reflect on the product, its intent and its relationship to the target audience. Distribution The product is delivered to the target audience in a planned context and location.", "id": "chunk_263"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Curriculum", "id": "chunk_264"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Foundation Level description", "id": "chunk_265"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Foundation, learning in Media Arts builds on the Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Framework (VEYLDF) and each student\u2019s prior learning and experiences.

Music has the capacity to motivate, inspire and enrich the lives of all students. Students participate in music learning individually and collectively as listeners, composers and performers. Music learning is embodied learning. It has a significant and unique impact on the creative, sensorimotor, cognitive, emotional, sociocultural and personal competencies of students. Music exists distinctively in every historical and contemporary culture, and is a basic, shared expression and communication of human experience. Sharing music and ideas about music across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts builds knowledge and enhances empathy, and fosters understanding of other cultures, times, places and contexts. Engagement with music from diverse settings develops an understanding that the same music can be deeply moving for many people and yet have different meaning for each. Music is a significant element in the diversity and continuity of local and global cultures, particularly the cultures of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. Through music, they express connection to Country and Place, challenge the impact of other cultures on their ways of knowing, being, doing and becoming, contribute to the global music community and advocate for change.", "id": "chunk_315"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Students\u2019 active participation in music, through continuous and developmentally sequential music learning, encourages skills and aesthetic knowledge of increasing depth and complexity over time. Through performing, composing and listening with intent to music, students have access to knowledge, skills and understanding that can be gained in no other way. Music learning enhances students\u2019 capacity to perceive and understand musical concepts, and to recognise music\u2019s contribution in shaping their identity and their ability to explore personal, local and global issues and ideas. Learning in the Music curriculum is aurally based and can be understood without any recourse to notation; learning to read and write music in traditional and graphic forms enables students to access a wide range of music as independent learners. Through the study of Music, students increasingly value the power of music in its ability to transform the heart, soul, mind and spirit of individuals and communities.

Music comprises 4 interrelated strands: Exploring Developing Practices Creating Presenting. Exploring In this strand, students learn as listeners, composers and performers. They explore: diverse examples of how, where and why people create, make, perform, present and respond to music the contexts and roles of music in the lives of individuals and groups across cultures, times, places and communities the diversity and significance of music for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, cultures and communities how music communicates cultural and aesthetic knowledge, purpose, meaning and emotion how music develops empathy and understanding of multiple perspectives. Students respond using music practices and forms, imagery, sounds, movement, language and digital tools. They listen with intent and use listening skills and imagination to develop ideas in response to stimuli such as music they have listened to, observations, feelings, experiences and research. They explore ways of using and manipulating the elements of music and compositional devices. Developing Practices In this strand, students develop practices and skills for listening to, composing, performing and responding to music. They develop knowledge and understanding through play, imagination, experimentation, creative and critical thinking, and practice. They use their voices, instruments, safe practice principles and guidelines, materials such as scores and sheet music, amplification equipment and digital tools as appropriate to develop creative and critical practices including: creative skills and confidence for interpreting, performing and composing music, using the elements of music, listening and aural skills, vocal and instrumental techniques, and available materials and digital tools critical skills for listening to, observing, reflecting on, analysing and evaluating their own and others\u2019 music practices, using language/terminology and embodied practices. Creating In this strand, students as artists apply music-specific or multi-arts creative processes to compose music and interpret music for performance. As audiences, they reflect on their work as it develops, for example through observation, using aural skills, analysis, reflection and evaluation. Individually and collaboratively, using available voices, instruments (acoustic, electric, digital and environmental) and digital tools, students manipulate and exploit elements of music to: compose in forms and styles of interest and relevance through songwriting, improvisation, genre-specific forms such as chamber music, music production, arranging/re-imagining, music for specific purposes or occasions, or music for multi-arts works interpret music composed and performed by others use manual and digital tools to notate, document and record their compositions and interpretations. Presenting In this strand, students perform their compositions and interpretations of music composed by other people in informal and formal settings in available physical or virtual spaces. Some performances will be refined; others will be presentations or demonstrations of work in progress.

They are provided as advisory material only. Learning in Music Elements of music The elements of music underpin all Music learning. These are duration/time (including tempo, rhythm and metre), pitch, tone colour/timbre, texture, structure/form, dynamics and articulation. Musical ideas are conceived, organised and shaped by aspects and combinations of the elements of music. Other elements of music may be included, particularly at Levels 9 and 10, for example elements to align with senior secondary courses. Listening Throughout their Music learning, students listen to, experience, analyse, evaluate, perform and compose music from diverse cultures, styles, traditions and contexts. They learn to recognise their subjective preferences and appreciate other people\u2019s diverse perspectives of music. Students\u2019 approaches to composing and interpreting music as performers are informed by their responses to music that they experience. As they develop their music knowledge and skills, students develop their own musical voice as composers and their own style as performers. Purposeful or intentional listening skills engage the listener\u2019s mind, senses and emotions. They are used when listening for enjoyment, analysing, responding to, reflecting on, evaluating, composing and performing music. Aural skills are listening skills used to identify and analyse specific elements of music, such as the duration of a note, the interval (distance) between 2 notes or the structure/quality of a chord. Aural skills complement purposeful or active listening and can be used when listening, composing and performing. Composing Composing describes the practices and processes used to create music works. It can include, for example, songwriting, improvising, arranging/re-imagining/re-inventing, music production and/or generating. Composing involves creative processes such as developing ideas or intentions, identifying purpose, evaluating and analysing ideas from other music, manipulating elements of music to organise and shape musical ideas, and using compositional devices to structure or extend the music. Notating, documenting and recording Notating, documenting and recording involves using available and relevant methods and tools to preserve music for future use. Forms and methods of notating, documenting and recording include staff notation, graphic notation, scores, charts, lead-sheets, and audio and audiovisual recordings. These forms and methods are often associated with genres or styles. Notating, documenting and recording can involve using symbols, images and digital tools. Performing Students perform for audiences of one or more in informal settings such as in classes or instrumental lessons, to peers or teachers. They may also present formal performances in a school or public setting. Formats for performances include live (indoor or outdoor), streamed and recorded. Instruments Students use available instruments for performing and composing. Instruments can include voice or body, acoustic or electric string, wind, percussion, keyboard instruments, digital instruments and environmental sounds. Viewpoints In Music, students respond to musical experiences and ideas through the practices of listening, composing and performing. Throughout their Music learning, students use questions based on viewpoints (personal and imaginative, cultures and worlds, conventions and structure) as an inquiry tool for considering their responses and music practice from multiple perspectives, as artists or as audiences. Students can use questions based on viewpoints to: structure their reasoning and reflecting explore ideas and make decisions explore and develop empathy for multiple perspectives express and celebrate identities, ideas and meaning think deeply about their own music practices and works and music composed and performed by others that they experience. As they create and respond to music works and experiences, students develop questions to explore ideas, perspectives and meaning. They think and make decisions as artists and as audiences. Questions based on viewpoints encourage students to consider a range of perspectives and to think deeply about their own music works and music created by others.", "id": "chunk_324"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Curriculum", "id": "chunk_325"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Foundation Level description", "id": "chunk_326"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Foundation, learning in Music builds on the Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Framework (VEYLDF) and each student\u2019s prior learning and experiences.

In Foundation, students explore music by learning to listen and respond to music, becoming aware of the elements of beat, rhythm, pitch, dynamics and tempo as they sing, play, improvise and move to music. They learn to feel the beat, sing with pitch awareness and discriminate between sound and silence, loud and soft, and fast and slow.

Learning in, through and about these fields, students engage critically using creative processes and artistic practices to communicate and make meaning. Visual arts creative processes and practice provide insights into the impacts culture can have on ways of knowing, doing and being in Australia and the world. Investigating these impacts is integral to fostering students\u2019 abilities to discern and understand the unique ways visual arts practice and creative processes can be both related and distinct to learning about culture. Visual arts are central to the diverse and continuing cultural practices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. Through visual arts, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists articulate and express connection to and responsibility for Country and Place. Learning about visual techniques, technologies, skills and media of local and global artists and craftspeople supports students to develop their own artworks with integrity and understanding of distinctions between art and culture. Students explore different perspectives to develop and expand perceptual, conceptual and cultural understanding, critical reasoning and practical skills. From this, students develop confident and proficient practices to achieve a personally responsive and distinctive visual aesthetic. Students understand how creative industries contribute to personal, cultural, community and economic wellbeing. In Visual Arts, students learn to recognise and cultivate unique literacies, practices and creative processes to grapple with ideas, intricacies and dilemmas. The interrelationship between making and responding invites students to investigate, contextualise and make meaningful connections between personal and global perspectives as they apply Visual Arts knowledge, frameworks and practical skills. Investigating artworks and practices prepares students to respectfully recognise, articulate and acknowledge artistic and cultural influences. In exploring how, why, where and for whom artists and craftspeople produce artworks, students recognise and appreciate the tensions, complexities and significance of visual arts histories, theories and practices.

Visual Arts comprises 4 interrelated strands: Exploring Developing Practices Creating Presenting. Exploring In this strand, students learn as artists and as audiences and viewers. They explore: visual arts practices in community, studio and/or industry settings across local, regional, national and global contexts visual arts works and their display in physical, virtual, formal and/or informal settings the diversity of where, why and how people create, make and engage with visual arts the diversity and significance of visual arts for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, cultures and communities how visual arts communicate cultural and aesthetic knowledge, ideas, purpose, meaning and emotion how visual arts develop empathy and understanding of multiple perspectives. Students respond using visual arts practices, materials and forms, imagery, sounds, movement, language and/or digital tools. Developing Practices In this strand, students develop practices and skills for exploring, creating and responding to visual arts. Students develop knowledge and understanding through play, imagination, experimentation, and critical and creative thinking. They develop creative and critical practices including: creative skills and confidence for using, experimenting with and manipulating visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials for personal expression and communicating visually in diverse two-dimensional (2D), three-dimensional (3D) and/or four-dimensional (4D) visual arts forms and styles critical skills in observing, documenting, reflecting on, analysing and evaluating their own and others\u2019 visual arts practices using language/terminology, embodied practices and/or problem-solving. Creating In this strand, as artists, students use visual conventions, visual arts\u2013specific and/or multi-arts creative processes, and visual arts materials. As audiences and viewers, they reflect on their work as it develops, for example through observation, analysis, reflection and evaluation. Students create and make visual arts works by: selecting, refining and resolving ideas and intentions for visual arts works identifying ideas and influences that will inform their work from, for example, other artists\u2019 artworks and practices, experiences, themes or concepts selecting and manipulating visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials to represent ideas, perspectives and/or meaning. Presenting In this strand, students present visual arts works to audiences and viewers.

They are provided as advisory material only. Learning in Visual Arts Visual arts practices Visual arts practices are the ways that artists go about their work. Visual arts practices include: examining other artists\u2019 works and practices; for example, identifying and analysing influences or considering how artists are using and adapting arts processes developing critical and creative thinking when observing and analysing artists\u2019 works, and when documenting and reflecting on their own visual arts practice developing ideas, studio practice and collaboration experimenting with and developing knowledge and skills in using visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials creating artworks that represent ideas, perspectives and/or meaning considering where, how and why they share their artworks and ideas with viewers or audiences. Viewpoints Throughout their Visual Arts learning, students use questions based on viewpoints as an inquiry tool for considering their own and others\u2019 use of ideas and concepts from multiple perspectives. Students can use questions based on viewpoints to: structure their reasoning and reflecting explore ideas and make decisions explore and develop empathy for multiple perspectives express and celebrate identities, ideas and meaning think deeply about their own visual arts practices and visual arts works by others that they experience. As they create and respond to visual arts works and experiences, students develop questions to explore ideas, perspectives and meaning. They think and make decisions as artists and as audiences and viewers. Questions based on viewpoints encourage students to consider a range of perspectives and to think deeply about their own and others\u2019 visual arts works. Contexts The context of an artwork is the frame of reference that allows the meaning to be interpreted. Interpretation of the meaning of an artwork can evolve from the context. The context of an artwork can be the location and time in which the artwork is made, presented or viewed. Context can also be the economic, philosophical, historical, social or cultural influences on the practices of the artist, the artist\u2019s intentions, and their communication of ideas, values and beliefs in their artworks. Artists Artists include visual artists, craftspeople and designers. Artists work individually and collaboratively using diverse visual arts practices to create artworks. Students investigate the practice and artworks of artists working in diverse forms across cultures, times, places and other contexts. Students learn as artists as they develop their own visual arts practice. Artworks Visual arts works include art, craft works and/or design works. An artwork is an outcome of an artist\u2019s practice. An artwork may be a completed product or a work in progress. Artworks can be experienced in person and/or digitally, for example by visiting galleries, exhibition spaces or public places, or by accessing artworks in online gallery spaces or in printed media such as arts journals. Students may use strategies such as questions based on viewpoints, frames, frameworks or lenses to analyse and interpret artworks and artists\u2019 practices from multiple perspectives. Visual conventions Visual conventions are traditional, cultural and stylistic ways of working in visual arts, craft and design. They reflect agreed expectations for various art forms and are impacted by factors such as the time and culture they were created in and the choice of materials. Visual conventions are dynamic and evolve as visual art forms and practices develop over time. They include the elements and principles of art. Art elements include colour, line, shape, form, tone, texture, sound, time and light. Art principles include emphasis (including focal point), movement, rhythm, unity, variety, space, repetition (including pattern), balance, contrast, proportion and scale. Materials In Visual Arts, students manipulate and adapt a wide range of materials and technologies to make 2D, 3D and 4D works. These may include: physical materials such as paint, dyes, charcoal and clay contemporary or emerging materials such as digital media organic and recycled/repurposed materials such as dry leaves, recycled cardboard, plastic, fabric, textiles or household objects. Visual artists adapt and expand their practice to encompass and embrace new materials and ways of working. Visual arts forms Visual arts forms embrace traditional, cultural and stylistic forms. Forms used in Visual Arts learning may include but are not limited to painting, drawing, sculpture, ceramics, printmaking, mixed media, film, video, sound, performance, photography, textiles, fashion, digital artworks and installation in 2, 3 and 4 dimensions. Visual arts forms develop and evolve as artists adapt and explore new technologies and ways of working. Visual arts processes Visual arts processes are the processes used to create artworks. They include methods, tools, techniques and technologies relevant to the selected visual arts form and are continually evolving. Exhibiting and curating Artworks can be displayed for audiences and viewers in formal or informal settings. Displays of artworks can be curated in exhibitions in formal or informal settings. Curating refers to the process of selecting and organising material, such as artworks and aspects of artists\u2019 practice, that communicates the artists\u2019 processes, ideas, intentions and/or perspectives. Curating can be part of the process for preparing for the informal or formal exhibiting of artworks or art practice for an audience and viewers.", "id": "chunk_384"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Curriculum", "id": "chunk_385"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Foundation Level description", "id": "chunk_386"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Foundation, learning in Visual Arts builds on the Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Framework (VEYLDF) and each student\u2019s prior learning and experiences.

Students learn how to manipulate type and imagery when designing for specific contexts, purposes and audiences. Visual Communication Design addresses the potential of designers in a range of practices focusing largely on the appearance and function of objects, environments, messages and experiences. Visual communication design practices are central to the diverse and continuing cultures and histories of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. Through visual communication design practices, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander designers articulate and express connection to and responsibility for Country and Place. The discipline of Visual Communication Design, therefore, seeks to cultivate future-ready designers who have a critical and reflective eye and a refined aesthetic sensibility, and who are equipped with the skills, knowledge and mindsets necessary to address the problems of life. Through exposure to the cultures and traditions of design practice, students learn how designers visually communicate ideas and information when designing for people, communities and societies. They develop the knowledge, skills and dispositions required of a multidisciplinary designer who is a reflective, responsible and empathetic practitioner equipped with agency and initiative.

Visual Communication Design comprises 4 interrelated strands: Exploring Developing Practices Creating Presenting. Exploring In this strand, students learn as designers and as audiences. They explore: design practices in community, studio and industry settings across local, regional, national and global contexts visual communication designs in physical and virtual contexts the diversity and significance of visual communication design for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, cultures and communities formulating their own ideas and guiding their design practice using an understanding of \u2018good design\u2019 human-centred research methods to explore design problems that influence the lives of people, communities and societies circular design practices considering not only the needs of audiences or users, but also the environmental and social impact of their work. Students respond using design practices. Developing Practices In this strand, students develop knowledge and skills through making and responding across the fields of design practice. Students generate ideas, and develop and refine concepts for visual communication designs through exploration, imagination,\u202fexperimentation\u202fand by applying critical and creative thinking. They develop critical knowledge and skills by researching, observing, documenting, generating, reflecting on, analysing and evaluating their own and others\u2019 design practices using design terminology and problem-solving. They develop creative knowledge and skills by: exploring the visual communication design process, methods, media and materials to create visual communication designs and solutions exploring and experimenting with visual language to communicate information and ideas for visual communication designs exploring universal and culturally specific understandings of \u2018good design\u2019 exploring and applying human-centred research methods to resolve design problems that affect the lives of people, communities and societies exploring and applying circular design practices to consider not only the needs of audiences or users, but also the environmental and social effects of their work investigating ethical and legal obligations used in developing visual communication designs. Creating In this strand, students use drawing and typographic conventions, the visual communication design process, methods, materials, media, and design elements and principles. They evaluate and reflect at each stage of the visual communication design process, considering the target audience, users and communication need by: generating, developing, resolving and refining ideas researching and identifying sources of inspiration for the generation of ideas applying the visual communication design process, methods, materials, media, design elements and design principles to create visual communication designs across fields of design practice reflecting on the development and refinement of concepts using divergent and convergent design thinking developing skills in digital and manual drawing across fields of design practice and in phases of the visual communication design process. Presenting In this strand, students present their visual communication designs to their intended audience or users across various fields of design practice by: choosing an appropriate format to communicate and present visual communication designs that address client and communication needs, and share them with audiences and users considering the context of the presentation of their visual communication designs, in physical or virtual spaces.", "id": "chunk_434"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards", "id": "chunk_435"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards describe what students are typically able to understand and do, and they are the basis for reporting student achievement.", "id": "chunk_436"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Visual Communication Design, students progress along a learning continuum that provides the first achievement standard at Level 8 and then at Level 10.", "id": "chunk_437"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Content descriptions", "id": "chunk_438"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Visual Communication Design, content descriptions sequence and describe the knowledge, understanding and skills that teachers need to teach and students are expected to learn.

They are provided as advisory material only. Learning in Visual Communication Design Visual communication design practices Students explore how designers visually communicate concepts when designing messages, objects, environments and interactive experiences. They work together and independently to find and address design problems, making improvements to services, systems, spaces and places experienced by stakeholders, both in person and online. Students employ a design process together with convergent and divergent thinking strategies to discover, define, develop and deliver design solutions. Drawings are used to visually represent relationships, ideas and appearances, while models and prototypes are produced for the purposes of testing and presentation. Students reflect on the development and refinement of their ideas and concepts, delivering and receiving constructive feedback and expanding their design terminology. Students also consider the various factors that affect design decisions, including conceptions of good design, aesthetic effect, and economic, technological, environmental, cultural and social influences. Using human-centred design principles, together with ethical, legal, sustainable and culturally appropriate design practices, students consider the needs of individuals, communities and society in general. They learn about the relationships between design, place and time, acknowledging Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander design knowledges, histories, traditions and practices. Designers use a range of practices to develop visual communication designs and solutions including human-centred design practices and circular design practices. Viewpoints Viewpoints are an inquiry tool for considering the arts from multiple perspectives, as artist, designer or audience. Students use questions based on viewpoints to initiate and guide their explorations and responses, creative and critical practices, evaluation and reflection, and to inform decisions about the performance or exhibition/presentation of their work. For example, they may develop questions based on viewpoints to: structure their reasoning and reflecting explore ideas and make decisions explore and develop empathy for multiple perspectives express, communicate and celebrate identities, ideas and meaning think deeply about their own arts and design works and art created by others. As they create and respond to artworks and experiences, students develop questions to explore ideas, perspectives and meaning. They think and make decisions as designers, artists and audiences. Questions based on viewpoints encourage students to consider a range of perspectives and to think deeply about the creation of their own and others\u2019 visual communication designs. Contexts The context of a visual communication design can be the location and time in which it is made, presented or viewed. Context can also be the economic, philosophical, historical, social or cultural influences on the practices of the designer, and their communication of ideas, values and beliefs. The context of a visual communication design provides the reference for the communication of ideas and messages to audiences or users. Interpretation of the messages and ideas presented can evolve from the context. Design thinking Design thinking describes the processes, strategies and routines used by designers when developing solutions to problems. Design thinking can be divergent or convergent. Divergent thinking is open-minded, curious and imaginative. It suspends judgement, focusing instead on the multiple ways a problem might be solved in unusual, creative or unexpected ways. Convergent thinking is analytical, critical, reflective and comparative. It seeks to summarise, categorise and synthesise information in logical and efficient ways in order to clarify, reframe or resolve problems. Visual communication design process The visual communication design process is the process used to create visual communication designs. The process is iterative and passes through and revisits 4 distinct phases. Discover Research and gather insights into the problem at hand to understand the needs and experiences of audiences and stakeholders. Define Use convergent thinking strategies to make sense of research data by synthesising and clarifying the problem at hand. Students identify a client and their communication needs, and detail the purpose, context, audience and users as well as a list of constraints. Develop Use divergent thinking strategies to seek and analyse inspiration from a wide range of sources, generating imaginative ideas aligned with the communication need. Students use methods, media, materials, design elements and design principles to create, recreate and explore the potential of design ideas. Deliver Use convergent thinking strategies to reflect critically on ideas. Students use design criteria and feedback to select potential solutions and concepts to evaluate and refine further. They choose appropriate formats to communicate and present finished design solutions. Fields of design practice The scope of design practice expands from the design of communications, physical objects and environments to the improvement of experiences and interactions in larger systems and environments. Messages are communicated to audiences using visual language and serve a variety of purposes. Messages can include brand strategy, wayfinding, advertising and social media campaigns, visual merchandising, publications, signage, illustrations, printed collateral, products and packaging. Objects are designed to improve the quality of life for people, communities and societies, while also upgrading or improving existing designs. Objects can include products and packaging, furniture, fittings and homewares, transport, appliances, tools, machinery, costumes, toys, devices, industrial products, furniture, jewellery, textiles and fashion. Environments are designed for indoor, outdoor and virtual spaces. Environments can include residential and commercial buildings, interiors, performance and exhibition spaces, parks, streetscapes and gardens and environments for films and video games. Interactive experiences are designed for both the physical world and online, ensuring the objectives of audiences and users are met when engaging with a product, system or service. Visual language plays a crucial role in the design of interactive experiences. The design of interactive experiences considers the aesthetic qualities and usability of audiences\u2019 and users\u2019 touchpoints, wayfinding systems and interfaces encountered in physical spaces or on digital devices including apps, online platforms and social networking services. These can include the display, layout and relationship of icons, symbols, images and type, as well as additional elements such as sound and animation. Designers Designers work individually and collaboratively using design practices to create visual communication designs. Students investigate the practices of designers and the creation of their visual communication designs and solutions across diverse fields of practice and in different cultures, times, places and other contexts. Visual language Visual language is a system of communication in which ideas and information are conveyed to audiences through visual means. Designers use the components of visual language to resolve problems, combining images, symbols and type to influence how people experience or interact with places, systems and things. The design elements and principles are integral to the creation of visual language and its purpose. The design elements include point, line, shape, form, tone, texture, colour and type. The design principles are the conventions used to arrange and organise the design elements. Design principles include figure\u2013ground, balance, contrast, cropping, hierarchy, scale, proportion and pattern (repetition and alternation). Methods, materials and media Methods are the manual or digital processes used to generate, develop, refine and resolve design ideas, concepts and solutions. These can include drawing, collage, printing, photography, model-making and prototyping. Visual communication designs are made using a wide range of materials. These may include paper, card, textile, metal, plastic, glass, touchscreen or digital interface. Media are the manual and digital applications used to visually communicate ideas and information. Manual media can include pencil, ink, markers, paint and analog film. Digital media can include software, apps and online platforms used for graphic, game or interaction design, four-dimensional (4D) representations, web development, concept art, illustration, three-dimensional (3D) drawing, modelling and rendering, photo editing and animation. Technologies The use of technologies is integral to visual communication design practices. In visual communication design, a range of available digital (e.g. hardware and software) and analog (e.g. pencils, paper, markers and ink) materials, media and methods are used by designers to produce visual communication designs and reflect critically on the use of technologies in visual communication design practices.", "id": "chunk_440"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Curriculum", "id": "chunk_441"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Levels 7 and 8 Band description", "id": "chunk_442"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Levels 7 and 8, learning in Visual Communication Design builds on each student\u2019s prior learning and experiences in the Arts and Design and Technologies.

Fundamental to physical education are the acquisition and application of movement skills, concepts and strategies across a range of contexts. Movement is a powerful medium for learning, through which students can acquire and practise physical, social, psychological and cognitive skills. When learning in movement contexts, students gain skills, understanding and dispositions that enable them to participate confidently and competently to support lifelong involvement in physical activity and enhanced movement performance. This includes learning in a range of contexts, including community, aquatic and outdoor environments, in order to promote a sense of wellbeing, enhance personal and social skills, and help students understand the concept of risk versus challenge. Health education addresses contextual factors that influence the health, safety, relationships and wellbeing patterns of individuals, groups and communities.

Strengths-based approach A strengths-based approach recognises that students have varying levels of access to the personal skills, strengths, assets and community resources they need to maintain and promote their own and others\u2019 wellbeing. Health and Physical Education recognises that contextual factors impact people\u2019s decisions and behaviours in relation to their health, safety, wellbeing and participation in physical activity. A strengths-based approach takes a positive view of health, rather than focusing only on potential health risks or a deficit model of health. A stronger focus on supporting students to develop the knowledge, understanding and skills that will enhance their own and others\u2019 health and wellbeing is a feature of a strengths-based approach. Applying a strengths-based approach requires teachers to view participation in health and physical activity as a process that students need to make sense of for themselves, rather than a single outcome students need to achieve. When this proposition is applied as part of the planning process, teaching and learning programs: support students to find solutions and plans of action that work for them as individuals, rather than promoting a \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 approach to being healthy, safe or active explore strategies to access community resources and the role individuals play in contributing to the health, safety and wellbeing of their families and communities. Valuing movement Movement in all its forms is central to daily life. It meets functional requirements and provides opportunities for active living. Valuing movement means recognising participation in physical activity and sport as significant social practices. Physical education develops knowledge, understanding, skills and dispositions through meaningful movement experiences to support ongoing participation in physical activity across the lifespan. It emphasises the development, transfer and adaptation of movement skills and understandings within and across different movement contexts. When planning movement experiences, teachers must be careful not to value certain movement skills and contexts over others, which may unintentionally privilege or marginalise some students. When this proposition is applied as part of the planning process: movement is identified as not only content to be taught, but also a context for learning programs explore and value diverse ways of moving and reasons for moving programs engage and challenge all students in and through movement. Health literacy", "id": "chunk_488"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Health literacy is an individual\u2019s ability to access, understand, interrogate and use health information and services to promote the health and wellbeing of themselves and others. Consistent with a strengths-based approach, health literacy is a personal and community asset. Health education focuses on developing knowledge, understanding and skills related to 3 dimensions of health literacy: functional, interactive and critical. The curriculum promotes the progressive development of health literacy skills using a critical inquiry approach. First, students can access and apply information to respond to a health-related question. Then, they can independently apply new information to changing health contexts. Finally, they can selectively access, analyse, evaluate and synthesise health information from a variety of sources to actively promote their own and others\u2019 health and wellbeing. When this proposition is applied as part of the planning process, teaching and learning programs: help students become critical consumers of health information who can critique the reliability of published content from a range of sources provide opportunities to access, critique and use relevant and meaningful health information and support networks encourage students to apply their health knowledge and skills in a variety of complex and meaningful contexts. Critical inquiry approach Health and Physical Education promotes a critical inquiry approach to examining the information, ideas and views that are commonly expressed in the media and society. This approach is key to the development of health literacy. Health and Physical Education also recognises that contextual factors, which often fall outside of an individual or a community\u2019s control, influence lifestyle choices. We often see these factors referred to as the social determinants of health. Each of the focus areas draws explicit attention to these determinants, which powerfully shape our health. A critical inquiry approach develops skills to research, analyse, apply and appraise knowledge to investigate meaningful, real-life situations and problems and respond with creative solutions or alternatives. Additionally, a critical inquiry approach develops and refines the skills needed to make sense of social, cultural and political issues from personal perspectives based on lived experiences. Critical inquiry helps students build and consolidate health literacies. When this proposition is applied as part of the planning process, teaching and learning programs: provide frequent opportunities for students to challenge, question and interrogate knowledge and assumptions in the health and movement fields encourage students to use a critical lens when interrogating information and ideas commonly expressed in society recognise that efforts to be and remain healthy, safe, well and active are shaped by a range of social, economic and political contextual factors that significantly impact on health.

Emphasis is often placed on the federal system of government, and our democratic institutions and systems, which are derived from the Westminster system. The liberal democratic values that underpin our democracy, such as freedom, equality and the rule of law, are given prominence throughout. The curriculum examines how the people, as citizens, choose their governments and keep them accountable; how the system safeguards democracy by vesting people with civic rights and responsibilities; how legal systems are designed to maintain peace and stability and to protect people\u2019s rights and promote justice; and how individuals and groups can influence society.

While the curriculum has a strong focus on the Australian context, students also reflect on Australia\u2019s position in the world, and the role of citizens today, both within Australia and in an interconnected world. Through the study of Civics and Citizenship, students develop inquiry skills, values and dispositions that encourage responsible participation in Australia\u2019s democracy and enable them to be active and informed citizens who question, understand and contribute to the world in which they live. By investigating contemporary issues and events, students learn to value their role in a democratic, diverse and dynamic society. They are enabled to develop informed points of view and to make positive contributions to society \u2013 locally, nationally, regionally and globally. As reflective, active and informed decision-makers, students are well placed to contribute to an evolving and healthy democracy that fosters the wellbeing of Australia as a democratic nation. Aims Civics and Citizenship aims to ensure that students develop: a lifelong engagement with civic life as active and informed citizens, who develop and maintain a sense of belonging in their communities in the context of Australia as a secular, democratic nation with a dynamic, culturally diverse and multi-faith society, with a Christian heritage, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nations an understanding of and a commitment to the core concepts of active citizenship from local to global; community, identity and diversity; democratic institutions and systems; democratic values; and legal systems skills including investigating contemporary civics and citizenship issues; evaluating democratic institutions and systems; participating in civic processes; and communicating the capabilities and dispositions to participate responsibly in the civic life of their communities and as people in an interconnected and interdependent world.

The sub-strands can be taught separately or together, through the exploration of contemporary issues. Knowledge and Understanding Government and democracy Students study Australian democracy and the key institutions, processes, systems and roles that people play in Australia\u2019s system of government. Laws and citizens Students examine Australia\u2019s legal system, the creation of laws and the rights and legal obligations of Australian citizens. Citizenship, diversity and identity Students examine the diverse meanings and values of citizenship. They also examine Australia as a culturally diverse and multi-faith society; factors that shape identity; and the rights and responsibilities of citizens in a globalised world. Skills Investigating contemporary civics and citizenship issues Students develop and modify questions to investigate contemporary political, legal and civic issues. They locate, sort and evaluate information, data and ideas from a range of sources. Evaluating democratic institutions and systems Students analyse information, data and ideas to evaluate different perspectives, beliefs and interpretations about democratic institutions and systems. They evaluate how Australian political, legal and civic institutions enhance and foster democratic values and civic participation. Participating in civic processes Students participate in and evaluate civic processes, including discussing, deliberating and negotiating outcomes. They evaluate the methods and strategies related to making decisions about civic participation or action. Communicating Students use civics and citizenship knowledge and evidence to communicate descriptions, explanations and arguments. They use evidence from sources to describe, explain and evaluate civics and citizenship issues. Core concepts The Knowledge and Understanding and Skills strands develop the following core concepts with increasing complexity across Levels 3 to 10. Active citizenship \u2013 local to global Active citizenship refers to responsive and informed participation in civic life for the betterment of one\u2019s community. Citizenship is provided through the recognition of obligations, rights and common interests, and sometimes includes legal mechanisms. Citizenship can operate at different levels, from local to global. Community A community has certain values, characteristics, rights and responsibilities common to its members, which bring the community together. People belong to communities and their identities are formed within communities. Australians are members of many diverse communities; this diversity is founded on the values of inclusivity, pluralism and democracy. Democratic institutions and systems Australia\u2019s democracy is founded on, and within, certain political, legal and civic institutions and systems. These institutions and systems express the values underpinning our democracy. These institutions include parliaments, political parties, courts, prisons, local councils and schools. These systems include federalism, the Westminster system, representative and constitutional government, an independent judicial system and welfare systems. Democratic values Key democratic values include popular sovereignty and \u2018consent of the governed\u2019: a belief in citizens\u2019 right to determine their own future; to choose their own governments; to be treated equally; to live freely and under the rule of law; to be accepted as part of a diverse community; and to participate as active and engaged citizens with recognised rights and responsibilities. Other democratic values include pluralism; an acceptance of the will of the majority; the protection of minorities; and an expectation that governments will be accountable to the people. Freedom is fundamental to democratic values, and includes the freedoms of speech, association, assembly, religion and movement. Identity and diversity Identity is a person\u2019s sense of who they are, and the conception and expression of their individuality or association with a group, culture, state, nation or region of the world, regardless of their legal citizenship status. Students\u2019 understanding of diversity includes acknowledging Australia as a culturally diverse, multi-faith and cohesive society. Legal systems Legal systems seek to establish mechanisms for order, justice and obedience in societies. Importantly, acceptance of the right of an elected legislative and executive branch to establish courts and make laws is fundamental to democratic societies. Students should understand that the rule of law is an essential democratic value. The rule of law is the agreement of all citizens, regardless of their power or position, to be equally bound by the laws of the land.", "id": "chunk_541"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards", "id": "chunk_542"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards describe what students are typically able to understand and do, and they are the basis for reporting student achievement.", "id": "chunk_543"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Civics and Citizenship, students progress along a learning continuum that provides the first achievement standard at Level 4, and then at Levels 6, 8 and 10.", "id": "chunk_544"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Content descriptions", "id": "chunk_545"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Civics and Citizenship, content descriptions sequence and describe the knowledge, understanding and skills that teachers need to teach and students are expected to learn.

Discussions surrounding contemporary issues and engaging in real-world case studies are important for relevant and meaningful learning. The discussion of contemporary issues can build democratic values, such as tolerance, and enhance civic knowledge and civic participation and engagement. Engaging students in contemporary issues provides opportunities for student voice and agency. Focusing on contemporary issues enables students to engage with key political, legal and civic issues, and to become active and informed citizens.", "id": "chunk_547"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Making connections between what is learned in class and events or issues that are occurring in the students\u2019 local area, Australia and the world is vital to the study of Civics and Citizenship.

The curriculum can be taught through relevant and contemporary contexts, real-world issues and current affairs by integrating current events, issues and case studies into teaching and learning programs through the Knowledge and Understanding strand. The contemporary issues, examples and case studies used in learning activities should be within the recent memory of students to ensure relevance and provide the opportunity for increased student engagement. Students examine contemporary issues through approaches such as class discussions, debates, civic action, role-plays, volunteering, student participatory research, community service and advocacy. Active citizenship Active citizenship focuses on the actions that citizens can take to improve their community. \u2018Community\u2019 may refer to the school community, the local community, the state, the nation or the global community. The nature of active citizenship will differ between schools. Active citizenship may be as small as improving a classroom recycling program or could include large, school community social service programs, student leadership programs, volunteer programs and partnership programs with local councils or groups outside the school.", "id": "chunk_548"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The curriculum encourages students to consider the ways in which they can participate in school, local, state, national and global communities.

Students require this knowledge and these skills to lead successful, productive and financially stable lives as Australian citizens, voters and participants in the economy. Students who acquire effective economic, business, entrepreneurial, and consumer and financial literacy skills and knowledge, combined with an ability to operate effectively in a work setting, are better equipped to manage personal finances successfully, run a business profitably and avoid the mismanagement that may lead to personal debt and other financial problems. Global flows of people, resources, finances and information create social, economic, political and environmental complexities and challenges. Consequently, Australia needs enterprising individuals and businesses who embrace opportunity, are informed decision-makers and have the capacity to make an economic contribution. Young Australians will all face social, economic, environmental and ethical challenges in their lifetime. These will impact both personal economic decision-making and their lives generally. It is critical, therefore, that students be equipped with the knowledge, understanding and skills to respond effectively to the challenges they will face as consumers, employees, future entrepreneurs and participants in the local, national and global economies. Aims Economics and Business aims to ensure that students develop: knowledge about and understanding of work and business environments within the Australian economy, the factors influencing businesses\u2019 decision-making and the importance of entrepreneurship to business success understanding of resource allocation, opportunity cost and economic decision-making, and application of these concepts to the economy, the business environment and entrepreneurship, work and work futures, and consumer and financial literacy understanding of the importance of being a participant in the economy through work, operating a business, being a financially literate consumer and informed economic decision-making appreciation of the key economic and business issues affecting contemporary Australian society, and an understanding of how Australia interacts and is interdependent with the global economy, including the Asia region reasoning and interpretation skills through application of economics and business concepts and theory to economics and business issues and events, modelling problem-solving and economic decision-making skills required for inquiry, including questioning and researching, interpreting and analysing, decision-making and communicating.

Knowledge and Understanding The Knowledge and Understanding strand provides content and contexts that develop in increasing complexity from Levels 5 to 10. Economics is the study of how scarce resources combine to create finished goods and services, which are used, allocated/distributed and exchanged in society. The study of business management examines the factors, knowledge and skills involved in establishing, managing and operating a successful business operation. Economic and business knowledge refers to the facts, principles, theories and models within economics and business. Economic and business understanding is the ability to recognise the relationships between, and apply, economic and business concepts, content and contexts. Economic literacy Students develop an understanding of, and an ability to apply, the basic economic concept of scarcity to rational economic decision-making. They are introduced to free market operations driven by supply and demand and consumer sovereignty, as well as the factors that influence economic decision-making. Students consider macroeconomics and the circular flow model of the economy, and through this they consider the interdependence of different economic sectors and the requirement for government economic intervention. Economic indicators are studied to measure economic success. Australia\u2019s interactions in the global economy are considered through the lens of international trade and markets. This sub-strand includes knowledge and understanding about: scarcity and economic decision-making market operations the circular flow model the means and requirement for government economic intervention economic indicators Australia and the global economy. Business and entrepreneurship Students learn about the planning, establishment and operation of businesses in Australia. They study how a business can compete successfully and recognise and respond effectively to opportunities as they arise. Students consider the effects of changing economic conditions on a business and how economic decisions are made by a business, through an understanding of the production and exchange of goods and services; markets and trade relationships; the creation and maintenance of competitive advantage; and the interdependence of the different economic sectors. Students learn about the skills and capabilities required for the calculated risk-taking of entrepreneurs in developing and implementing business innovation. This is done through an understanding of the importance of effective management of a business and employees; innovation to create and maintain competitive advantage; management of a workforce; and improvement of productivity in a range of business contexts. This sub-strand includes knowledge and understanding about: planning, establishment and operation of Australian businesses how businesses can successfully compete the effects of changing economic conditions on business business decision-making skills and capabilities of successful entrepreneurs the importance of effective business management business innovation as a means to create and maintain competitive advantage. Work Students learn about the contribution of work to both individual and community wellbeing, through an understanding of different conceptions and types of work; the importance of work; factors influencing a work environment; the rights and responsibilities of participants in the Australian work environment; and processes that businesses use to manage the workforce. Students also consider the future of work and predict changes to the nature of work. This sub-strand includes knowledge and understanding about: the contribution of work to both individual and community wellbeing different conceptions and types of work factors influencing the work environment the rights and responsibilities of participants in the Australian workplace human resource management the future of work. Consumer and financial literacy Students learn about how financial decision-making affects both personal and community wellbeing. Students develop appropriate skills and knowledge through the consideration of the rights and responsibilities of consumers and businesses; planning and budgeting processes; risk management; and informed financial decision-making. The importance of saving and financial planning is considered through development of personal budgeting and planning skills. This sub-strand includes knowledge and understanding about: the importance of consumer and financial literacy to both individuals and the community the rights and responsibilities of consumers and businesses planning and budgeting informed financial decision-making saving and financial planning. Skills This strand is organised in 2-year bands under 4 sub-strands. Investigating Students develop and modify questions to investigate contemporary economic and business issues. They locate, select and analyse information and data from a range of sources for relevance and reliability. Interpreting and analysing data and information Students interpret and analyse information and data about economic and business issues, trends and cause-and-effect relationships. They make predictions about consumer and financial impacts. They evaluate data and data sources for authenticity and validity. Evaluating, concluding and decision-making Students develop and evaluate responses to economic and business issues, using cost-benefit analysis or criteria to decide on a course of action and draw and justify logical conclusions based on these. Communicating When investigating, explaining and presenting contemporary economic and business issues, students use relevant economic and business knowledge, research findings, concepts and terms to create descriptions, explanations and reasoned responses.", "id": "chunk_587"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards", "id": "chunk_588"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards describe what students are typically able to understand and do, and they are the basis for reporting student achievement.", "id": "chunk_589"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Economics and Business, students progress along a learning continuum that provides the first achievement standard at Level 6, and then at Levels 8 and 10.", "id": "chunk_590"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Content descriptions", "id": "chunk_591"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Economics and Business, content descriptions sequence and describe the knowledge, understanding and skills that teachers need to teach and students are expected to learn.

Each contributes to a student\u2019s ability to interact effectively within the Australian economy, workplaces, businesses and as financially literate consumers and citizens: Economic literacy \u2013 All citizens require economic literacy to understand economic decision-making, why it is necessary and how it is done at both a micro level (individual and organisational) and macro level (government). Business and entrepreneurship \u2013 Business and entrepreneurship knowledge and related skills are important for successful participation in the commercial world as entrepreneurs and business operators. Work \u2013 The study of work and its evolution is important to students as future workforce participants. Different conceptions and types of work are considered, and the importance of work to both the individual and society is explored. The different means by which Australians may derive income is considered, as is the changing nature of contemporary work in Australia. Consumer and financial literacy \u2013 Consumer and financial literacy skills are core life skills essential for Australians to lead financially secure and stable lives. Development of skills and capabilities Through the study of Economics and Business Levels 5 to 10, students develop skills, attributes and behaviours that enable them to engage and contribute meaningfully as consumers, taxpayers, citizens, business owners and employees. Skills that enable them to research, locate, interpret and effectively utilise data and information are developed, as are skills that develop evidence-based responses, which are then effectively communicated. Contemporary economics, business, work and financial issues are investigated and addressed. Logical predictions about economics and business trends based on evidence are also made. Logical arguments are developed and communicated. Students develop and practise these skills and attributes in the context of economics and business issues. They are encouraged to deal with these issues in an ethical and rational manner. Associated behaviours, such as working in a team, planning, organising, reflecting and self-evaluating, should subsequently develop. Developing the skills associated with the study of economics and business will see students better equipped to be innovators; to work both independently and in teams; to identify, create, initiate and successfully manage personal, community, business and work opportunities; and to undertake effective and ethical economic and financial decision-making.

These 7 concepts are applied to learning in Geography to build a holistic understanding of a range of contemporary issues, from environmental issues (such as water resources, land degradation and sustainability) to human issues (such as urbanisation, food security and wellbeing) and the interconnections between them. Geography provides students with opportunities to develop a wide range of general skills, capabilities and dispositions that can be applied in everyday life and at work. Geography develops a respect for the environment, an appreciation and respect for social and cultural diversity, a capacity for teamwork, problem-solving abilities, and critical and creative thinking. Through their study of Geography, students are helped to become informed and responsible members of their local and global communities and to act ethically to shape a socially just and sustainable future. Geography also teaches science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) skills through its inquiry process, scientific studies of the environment, development of spatial thinking and use of geospatial technologies. Fieldwork is an essential component of learning in Geography and develops students\u2019 skills in observation, questioning, interpretation and collaboration. Aims Geography aims to ensure that students develop: a sense of wonder, curiosity and respect for places, environments, people and cultures throughout the world a deep geographical knowledge of their own locality, Australia, the Asia-Pacific region and the world an appreciation of geographical phenomena and issues, and their impact(s) on people\u2019s lives, places and environments the ability to think geographically, using geographical concepts the capacity to be competent, critical and creative users of geographical methods and skills the capacity to be informed, responsible and active citizens who can contribute to the development of a world that is environmentally and economically sustainable, and socially just.

The content descriptions of the 2 strands have been written so that this integration is possible at each band. Under each strand, content is further organised into sub-strands. Geographical Knowledge and Understanding The Geographical Knowledge and Understanding strand includes the facts, generalisations, principles and models developed in Geography. This knowledge is dynamic and its interpretation can be contested, with opinions and conclusions supported by evidence and logical argument. Geographical understanding is the ability to see the relationships between aspects of this knowledge and to construct explanatory frameworks to illustrate these relationships. It is also the ability to apply this knowledge to new situations or to solve new problems. The Geographical Knowledge and Understanding strand is supported by the 7 geographical concepts, which underpin learning in Geography.

Learning in Geography Learning in Geography requires students to develop geographical knowledge through the application of geographical concepts and skills. Geographical concepts The 7 geographical concepts of place, space, environment, interconnection, sustainability, scale and change are high-level ways of thinking that can be applied across the discipline of Geography. To understand them, it is necessary to recognise that they are concepts that geographers use to frame their thinking, not objects that they study. For example, while places are parts of the Earth\u2019s surface that have been defined, named and given meaning by people, the concept of place frames ways of thinking that are based on the significance and influence of places. The 7 concepts also have many dimensions, which are described below, and students can learn and use these specific ideas to think geographically. Place The concept of place explains why specific places have their particular characteristics and how these characteristics influence outcomes of environmental and human processes and people\u2019s lives at a local, regional and global scale.", "id": "chunk_631"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In the Victorian Curriculum F\u201310, through the concept of place, students learn how places influence the lives of people; how the unique characteristics of each place influence the outcomes of environmental and human processes; and how this may result in different responses to problems that are similar. Students develop an understanding of the concept of place by establishing the following: Places are parts of the Earth\u2019s surface that are identified and given meaning by people. They may be perceived, experienced, understood and valued differently by different people. They range in size from a part of a room or garden to a major world region and can be described by their location, shape, boundaries, features and environmental and human characteristics. Some characteristics are tangible, such as landforms, while others are intangible, such as scenic quality and culture. A region is a type of place. Places are important to our security, identity and sense of belonging, and they provide us with the services and facilities needed to support and enhance our lives. Where people live can influence their wellbeing and opportunities. The characteristics of a place are influenced by environmental processes over short to long time periods, as well as its resources, relative location, connections with other places, the culture of its population, the economy of the country in which it is located, and the decisions and actions of people and organisations over time and at different scales. The places in which we live are created, changed and managed by people. Each place is unique in its characteristics. Consequently, the outcomes of similar environmental and socioeconomic processes vary in different places, and similar problems may require different strategies in different places. The sustainability of places may be threatened by a range of factors, such as natural hazards; climate change; economic, social and technological change; government decisions; conflict; exhaustion of a resource; and environmental degradation. Space The concept of space is about the significance of location and spatial distribution, and the ways people organise and manage the spaces in which they live. Through the concept of space, students learn about the impacts of location and distance within and between places, and how these impact people\u2019s lives; the significance of how natural and human phenomena are spatially distributed; and the ways in which space is organised.", "id": "chunk_632"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In the Geography curriculum, students develop an understanding of the concept of space by establishing the following: While the environmental and human characteristics of places are influenced by their absolute and relative location, improvements in transport and communication technologies are reducing the impacts on people of location and distance from other places, though unequally. The individual characteristics of places form spatial distributions and the analysis of these distributions, and of the spatial association between them, contributes to geographical understanding. The spatial distributions also have environmental, economic, social and political consequences. Spaces are perceived, structured, organised and managed by people, and they can be designed and redesigned to achieve particular purposes. Environment The concept of environment is about the significance of the environment in human life and the important interrelationships between humans and the environment. Through the concept of environment, students come to appreciate the ways in which the biophysical environment supports human life, influences human activities and is being changed by human actions.", "id": "chunk_633"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In the Geography curriculum, students develop an understanding of the concept of environment by establishing the following: The environment is the product of interconnecting geological, atmospheric, hydrological, geomorphic, edaphic (relating to soil), biotic and human phenomena and processes. The environment supports and enriches human and other life by providing raw materials and food, absorbing and recycling wastes, maintaining a safe habitat and being a source of enjoyment and inspiration. It presents both opportunities for, and constraints on, human settlement and economic development. The constraints can be reduced, but not eliminated, by technology and human organisation. Culture, population density, type of economy, level of technology, values and environmental worldviews influence the different ways in which people perceive, adapt to and use similar environments. Management of human-induced environmental change requires an understanding of the causes and consequences of change, and can be assisted by applying geographical concepts and techniques to identify the causes and select appropriate responses. Each type of environment has its specific hazards. The impacts of hazard events on people are determined by both natural and human factors and can be reduced, but not eliminated, by prevention, preparedness, response and recovery. Interconnection The concept of interconnection emphasises that no geographical phenomenon can be viewed in isolation. Through the concept of interconnection, students learn about how geographical phenomena are influenced by their interrelationships with other phenomena, both within and between places.", "id": "chunk_634"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In the Geography curriculum, students develop an understanding of the concept of interconnection by establishing the following: Places and the people and organisations in them are interconnected with other places in a variety of ways. These interconnections have significant influences on the characteristics of places and on the ways in which these characteristics change. Environmental and human processes, such as the water cycle, urbanisation or human-induced environmental change, are sets of cause-and-effect interconnections that can operate between and within places. They can sometimes be organised as systems involving networks of interconnections through movement of matter, energy, information and actions. Holistic thinking looks for the interconnections between phenomena and processes within and between places. An ability to think holistically is essential when contemporary environmental, economic and social issues and challenges require multidisciplinary thinking. Sustainability The concept of sustainability is about the capacity of the environment to continue to support our lives and the lives of other living creatures into the future (environmental sustainability). It is also about the sustainability of places, and their economies, populations and cultures (economic and social sustainability). The concept of sustainability is used to evaluate the significance of environmental changes and the future of places.", "id": "chunk_635"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In the Geography curriculum, students develop an understanding of the concept of sustainability by establishing the following: Environmental, economic and social sustainability is a goal, and sustainable development is a way of progressing towards that goal. Progress towards environmental sustainability depends on maintaining and restoring the environmental functions that sustain all life and the economic and social wellbeing of humans. An understanding of the causes of unsustainability requires study of the environmental processes producing the degradation of an environmental function, the human actions that have initiated these processes, and the attitudinal, demographic, social, economic and political reasons for these human actions. These can be analysed through the framework of human-environment systems. People\u2019s attitudes towards sustainability are influenced by their environmental worldviews, which range from human-centred to eco-centred, and include concepts such as stewardship and custodial responsibility. Scale The concept of scale is about the way that geographical phenomena and problems can be examined at different spatial levels. It is used in combination with other concepts, for example the concept of change, to analyse data.", "id": "chunk_636"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In the Geography curriculum, students develop an understanding of the concept of scale by establishing the following: Generalisations made and relationships found at one level of scale may be different at a higher or lower level. For example, in studies of vegetation, climate is the main factor at the global scale but soil and drainage may be the main factors at the local scale. Cause-and-effect relationships cross scales from the local to the global and from the global to the local. For example, local events, such as the impacts of local vegetation removal, can have global outcomes. Change The concept of change is about explaining geographical phenomena by investigating how they have developed over time. It is used in combination with other concepts, for example scale, to analyse data.", "id": "chunk_637"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In the Geography curriculum, students develop an understanding of the concept of change by establishing the following: Environmental change can occur over both short and long timeframes, and both time scales have interrelationships with human activities. Environmental, economic, social and technological change is spatially uneven and affects places differently. An understanding of the current processes of change can be used to forecast change in the future and to identify what would be needed to achieve preferred and more sustainable futures.

Learning in Levels 7 to 10 The Geographical Knowledge and Understanding sub-strands in Levels 7 to 10 can be divided into 2 sequences of 4 sub-strands each. The first sequence focuses predominantly on human geography and is organised around the concepts of place, space and interconnection. The second sequence illustrates different aspects of the concept of environment by focusing on physical and environmental geography; students develop an understanding of the biophysical environment and people\u2019s relationships with it in a progression from water to landforms, vegetation, food production and environmental management. These sequences are shown in the following table. Table 2: Geographical Knowledge and Understanding sub-strands and main concepts Key questions Key questions are suggested for each band to stimulate student thinking and discussion. They are examples only and may be used or adapted to suit local contexts. Primary research methods, including fieldwork It is important that students have the opportunity to conduct active and firsthand collection, examination, interpretation and analysis of data and information about geographical questions. Learning in Geography provides opportunities for the application of geographical skills, and fieldwork can be conducted outside the classroom at a local scale. Geography uses a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative methods to represent, interpret and analyse data and information. Many of these are common to several learning areas, but there are 3 particular methods that are central to geographical study. These are: interpreting spatial distributions of specific phenomena, such as rainfall, deforestation, population or human wellbeing, to identify patterns that suggest questions to ask and possible causes to examine comparing spatial distributions of different phenomena to identify spatial associations between phenomena, which may be causal relationships comparing places to test relationships between variables. Use of geospatial technologies Geography learning experiences are enriched by using geospatial technologies. These enable students to collect, store, map, represent and visualise the occurrence of geographical phenomena, and identify issues for interpretation and analysis of causes, impacts and responses. For example, students can use geographical information systems (GIS) and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to create, view and analyse spatial data. They can view and analyse spatial data through remote sensing and in 3D and can manage and represent geographical data and information in a range of formats.", "id": "chunk_639"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Curriculum", "id": "chunk_640"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Foundation to Level 2 Band description", "id": "chunk_641"}, {"type": "Level", "id": "From Foundation to Level 2"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "From Foundation to Level 2, the Geography curriculum develops the concept of place through studies of what places are like, how they are identified and named, why they are important in students\u2019 lives and how students can care for them. Students recognise that their place has an identity, name and cultural significance for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, who have a special connection to places, and that their school is located on Country. The focus is on the places in which they live, but students also start to investigate other places of similar size that are familiar to them or that they are curious about. They learn about the location and nature of natural, managed and constructed features of local places. They consider how places change over time and the ways different groups of people have connection to and can care for places, including how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples care for Country and Place. They learn about the ways local people and places are connected to people and places at broader scales within their region and state or territory. Students are introduced to the concept of scale as they learn about the hierarchy of scales by which places are defined \u2013 from the personal scale of their home to the national scale of their country. Students\u2019 understanding of the concept of interconnection is developed by investigating the links people have with places locally and globally. The concept of environment is introduced as they study daily and seasonal weather patterns and the natural features of their place and other places, including how seasonal change is perceived by different cultures. They learn that seasons also illustrate that there can be different ways of describing the same phenomenon, because these are human constructs. Students are introduced to the concept of space by looking at the ways in which Australia can be politically divided in different ways. They develop an idea of active citizenship as they start to explore their feelings about special places, the wider importance of places to people and how places can be cared for.

Students examine water as a renewable environmental resource, its spatial distribution in Australia, how it is used and valued, and how societies attempt to manage its scarcity. The sub-strand concludes with a study of an atmospheric or hydrological hazard. Place and liveability explores how the characteristics of the places in which we live influence our lives in various ways and the various influences on people\u2019s perceptions of liveability, including the access to services and facilities, environmental quality, social connectedness and community identity needed to support and enhance our lives. Students consider the ways that the liveability of a place is enhanced and how sustainability is managed. The sub-strand concludes with an investigation of ways to improve the liveability of the local area, which provides opportunities for local fieldwork. Landforms and landscapes examines landforms (major elements in the environment) and the geomorphological processes that produce them. It explores the significance and meanings of landforms for people, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. Students explore the distribution of Australia\u2019s distinctive landscapes and significant landforms. They investigate the human activities that have changed landforms, through a case study of a chosen local landscape, and they explore ways of responding to damaging changes. They also consider the ways that the sustainability of significant landscapes and the impacts of hazards are managed. Changing nations examines urbanisation as a process that is transforming the world, and the urban patterns and issues it produces in both urbanising and highly urbanised countries. Students examine urbanisation as both a consequence of, and a contributor to, economic and social change. Students examine the distribution of population in Australia compared to other countries and shifts in population distribution over time.

Biomes and food security examines the characteristics of the world\u2019s biomes and their production of biomass, which is the source of the world\u2019s food. Students develop an understanding of the factors that influence food production (from climate to agricultural innovations) and of the impacts of food production and its methods on environments. Students then examine the environmental, economic and social sustainability of current farming methods in Australia. They evaluate if and how world food production can be increased to the level needed to feed future populations sustainably, and whether this would ensure food security. Geographies of interconnection illustrates how places and people are interconnected through travel, communication technologies and trade. Students consider examples of how people and businesses are connected to other people, services and information throughout the world. They examine interconnections through trade, and the impacts of these interconnections on places and environments, with a particular emphasis on North-East Asia. They assess the impacts of the interconnections produced by people\u2019s travel, recreational and cultural choices. Students consider the impacts of global interconnectedness on the spread of fashions, pandemics and financial disasters. Environmental change and management examines the functions of the environment that support people\u2019s lives and wellbeing, as well as ways of assessing the sustainability of these functions. Students identify environmental changes that threaten sustainability and therefore need management. Students examine the impacts of people\u2019s attitudes, values and ways of thinking on their views of environment management, first generally and then through the ways of thinking and practices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. Students have the opportunity to examine the causes and consequences of a change within the context of a specific environmental issue and the strategies to manage the change, including the application of geographical concepts and methods. Geographies of human wellbeing focuses on the question of human wellbeing, how it may differ from the concept of development and how it can be measured and mapped. Students consider the global pattern of wellbeing and then examine the spatial distribution of wellbeing within a country at a regional scale, for example using India (a country of growing importance to Australia) as the case study. Students examine the spatial distribution of wellbeing among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples.

In History, students use evidence from historical sources to construct explanations of the past. This past includes the events, developments and the experiences of individuals, communities and societies that have shaped our diverse contemporary world. In the Victorian Curriculum F\u201310, students learn about and come to understand themselves and their communities by engaging with the rich and enduring histories and cultures of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples; ancient and pre-modern societies; societies of Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe and the Pacific region; global themes; and the colonisation of the Australian continent and Australia\u2019s development as a nation. Learning in History is investigative, interpretive and creative. It asks and responds to questions about the past that give meaning to our shared histories and experiences, and helps in understanding ourselves and the actions of others. The interrelated historical skills and concepts that underpin this process include: historical questions chronology using historical sources continuity and change causes and consequences historical significance communicating. Through learning in History, students come to appreciate that pasts are contestable, shared and relevant to their world. Students learn that the diverse experiences of individuals, society, beliefs, events and developments in the past have shaped our shared experiences. History enables students to appreciate how the world, nations, communities and peoples have changed, and the significant continuities of the present day. This knowledge and understanding is essential for their informed and active participation as citizens in Australia\u2019s diverse society. Aims History aims to ensure that students develop: an interest in, and enjoyment of, historical study for lifelong learning and work by cultivating a sense of wonder and curiosity their capacity and willingness to be informed and active citizens by fostering an understanding of social diversity, inclusion and social participation knowledge, understanding and appreciation of the past, the experiences and perspectives of groups and individuals, and the forces that shape societies and environments, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, Australia, Asia and the Western world understanding and use of historical concepts and skills, including historical questions, chronology, using historical sources, continuity and change, causes and consequences, historical significance and communicating the capacity to undertake historical inquiry, including skills in analysing and using sources, and in explaining and communicating arguments.

At Levels 9 and 10, students study an Overview sub-strand and at least 4 Investigations sub-strands. Overviews The first sub-strand in each band is an overview. The Overview provides an expansive chronology that helps students understand broad patterns of historical change, and provides the broader context for the Investigations. It can provide students with an introduction to the historical period, make links to and between Investigations, and consolidate understanding through a review of the period. The overview is not intended to be taught in depth. Investigations Investigation sub-strands concern specific historical contexts and topics.

Historical Concepts and Skills This strand includes 7 sub-strands that support the development of historical thinking using the concepts and skills of the discipline. Further explanation of each Historical Concept and Skill can be found in the Learning in History section. Historical questions Students develop and apply historical questions to frame their historical investigation. Chronology Chronology is the organisation of historical phenomena into a time-based sequence. This process supports the development of historical narratives and the identification of continuity and change, and causes and consequences. Using historical sources Students identify and explain the features, content and context of historical sources, and evaluate the information about interpretations and perspectives they contain as evidence. Continuity and change Aspects of society, such as institutions, ideas, values and social organisation, may remain the same and/or change over periods of time. Changes may occur at different rates and magnitudes. Continuity and change may be evident in different aspects of a society at the same time. Causes and consequences Causes and consequences include the short- and long-term factors that contributed to continuity and change in the past, and the intended and unintended outcomes of an event, decision, action, process, interaction or development. Historical significance Historical significance is the importance assigned to an issue, event, development, person, group, place, society, process, interaction or system over time and place. The importance is determined by the prominence of the event, development or issue at the time, its scope and depth, its long-term consequences and its ability to explain issues in the present.

In the History curriculum, the substantive knowledge is the content \u2013 the events, the people and the developments in the past \u2013 and is identified in the Historical Knowledge and Understanding strand. This is the knowledge that students learn about. The disciplinary practices of History, often described as historical thinking, are the techniques and modes of thinking that are applied to the substantive knowledge. In the History curriculum, these disciplinary practices are described as Historical Concepts and Skills. This knowledge is what students learn to do.

There is considerable choice for topics within Investigations and schools should consider topics relevant to their school and wider context. Australian history within a world history approach Australian history should not be considered in isolation but examined as part of wider global processes. In Levels 7\u201310, students should study a balanced range of areas to develop an understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples\u2019 histories and cultures, the foundations of the Western world, Asia, and Australian history. Students should consider the significant events, people, groups and ideas in Australian history. They should make links between how global events can shape and influence national events and ideas, and explore Australian developments in a wider transnational and comparative context. Historical Concepts and Skills", "id": "chunk_701"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In the History curriculum, there are 7 Historical Concepts and Skills. These skills describe what students learn to do with the knowledge they have learned about. Students apply these concepts and skills at increasing levels of cognitive demand as they progress in their learning. The level of cognitive demand is expressed in the content descriptions. Figure 2: Historical Concepts and Skills are discrete yet closely connected disciplinary modes of thinking and doing. Historical Concepts and Skills are closely interrelated and are often applied holistically. However, these concepts and skills need to be taught explicitly so that students understand the thinking involved in each. This will support students\u2019 historical understanding and their construction of historical interpretation. The application of these concepts and skills is intrinsic to students\u2019 historical inquiry. A single learning activity or assessment should provide opportunities for students to demonstrate understanding and application of more than one concept and/or skill at a time. Historical questions The Historical questions sub-strand involves students identifying, selecting and using a range of different kinds of historical questions to inform historical inquiry and interpretation. When studying History, students\u2019 curiosity and investigation are shaped by the questions asked about the past. Their questions drive the process of historical inquiry. Students use questions to focus their thinking about historical knowledge and understandings and their use of historical sources. The responses to their questions inform their interpretations of the past. Historical questions may be descriptive, procedural, comparative or evaluative, and are used throughout the inquiry process. For descriptive questions, a student must identify or describe an event or development. For procedural questions, students need to recall knowledge, such as when an event occurred or what happened next. Comparative and evaluative questions typically combine historical knowledge and historical concepts and elicit higher-order thinking. Question types may also be combined so that a procedural question about a historical development becomes comparative or evaluative. For example, \u2018Why did the British establish colonies in Australia?\u2019 may be modified to \u2018Compare 2 causes of British colonisation of Australia\u2019 or \u2018Explain the most significant reasons for British colonisation of Australia\u2019. Table 3: Formulating meaningful historical questions Chronology The Chronology sub-strand involves students arranging events, ideas, peoples and developments in order of time to observe and explain patterns of continuity and change and causes and consequences. Chronology is the organisation of content knowledge and developments in time order sequence. This chronological ordering lays the foundation for student understandings of the sequences of, and relationships between, historical events, ideas and developments and the lives of individuals. By ordering historical phenomena in time order, students recognise patterns of continuity and change, analyse causes and consequences and distinguish between short- and long-term triggers or outcomes. Understanding historical time requires students to engage with a range of time scales, such as days, weeks, years, centuries and millennia. Students build explanatory narratives of the past based on the chronological sequences they create. It is in these narratives that students observe continuity and change, and causes and consequences. Using historical sources The Using historical sources sub-strand involves students reading, interpreting, analysing and evaluating historical sources so that evidence can be used to develop an explanation, interpretation or argument about the past.", "id": "chunk_702"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The use of historical sources is an integral skill of historical learning. Knowledge and interpretation of the past is based on information that is derived from historical sources. In the History curriculum, there are 4 elements to working with historical sources: features, content, context perspectives interpretations evaluation as evidence.", "id": "chunk_703"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Each of these elements develops across the continuum of learning in the History curriculum. The requirements are explicitly identified in the content descriptions and illustrated in the supporting elaborations. Features, content, context Historical sources take a variety of forms, convey information and come from specific historical times and places. The identification and understanding of features, content and context is the introduction to using historical sources. At the simplest level, the feature of a historical source is the type of source. Broadly, historical sources can be categorised into 2 forms, primary and secondary, within which there is enormous variety. Primary sources are from the time of, or shortly after, a historical event. They include oral and written accounts, stories, songs, speeches, laws, visual sources, such as photographs and posters, and objects, such as implements, tools, coins or buildings. Secondary sources are interpretations of the past created after the historical event they examine or explain. They include the work of historians, textbooks, documentaries, fiction and some forms of artwork, such as commemorative statues and historical paintings. When working with historical sources, students need to distinguish between primary and secondary sources and recognise the particular attributes of a source\u2019s form. The process of \u2018sourcing\u2019 also requires that students identify the content of the source. This is simplest in written sources, in which the explicit content can be readily identified. For example, a law is generally very clear and explicit. The information in other sources, such as illustrations, often requires wider knowledge, such as the meaning of symbols, such as crowns, swords or books, in medieval manuscripts. The content of material culture objects, such as tools, weapons or household objects, is not as literal, but such sources provide information about agricultural methods, military technology and domestic life. Identifying the content of sources also requires inference, the identification of what is not explicitly stated. Students also need to know the circumstances of the source\u2019s creation because this information can be used when evaluating the evidence in the source. Students establish the historical context of a source by asking historical questions, such as \u2018When was a speech delivered?\u2019 or \u2018Who was the intended audience?\u2019 Perspectives When students engage with primary sources, the content can provide insights into the beliefs, values and attitudes of people in the past. These beliefs, values and attitudes are the mindsets of historical actors that shaped the ways they saw and acted in their world. Through engagement with historical perspectives, students come to understand that people in the past did not have or were not motivated by the same beliefs, values or attitudes that they might hold. Engaging with perspectives invites students to identify and understand the world from the perspective of the individual in their historical context. This is sometimes referred to as historical empathy. The imposition of a student\u2019s own beliefs, values and attitudes onto individuals in the past should be avoided. Doing so risks presentism, which is the imposition of modern values or judgements on historical actors. Students should be encouraged to engage with multiple perspectives and explore the less-heard voices of the past, including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, children, women, workers and people who were not literate, to create a rich narrative and inquiry. The identification and consideration of the perspective of individuals in the past supports students to critically challenge or corroborate sources, assess their reliability and develop interpretations of the past that are sensitive to the factors that shaped the experiences and motivations of individuals. Interpretations Interpretations of the past, such as the works of historians, also contain information. Historians interpret the past based on their reading and evaluation and interpretation of primary sources, and the interpretations of others. History is an interpretative discipline, so explanations of the past can differ and change as new evidence emerges and new historical questions are posed. Even historians have a historical context and bring a perspective to their work. These differing responses to historical questions make the past contested. Students should engage with a variety of interpretations of the past to develop an understanding of the contestability of history. Doing so models their interpretative practice. Evaluation as evidence All historical sources contain content, but not all content is relevant or useful to the process of historical inquiry. Therefore, not all content drawn from historical sources is necessarily relevant to or useful in the development of historical interpretations. For information to become evidence, it must be evaluated. The process of evaluating information from historical sources as evidence requires students to identify the sources\u2019 features, content and context, and compare and contrast the sources with others, making judgements about accuracy and reliability, and determining the relevance to the topic of inquiry. Continuity and change The Continuity and change sub-strand involves students observing patterns of continuity and change in events, ideas, peoples and developments, identifying turning points that contribute to change and describing the varying pace, direction of change and the extent of the continuities and changes. Continuity and change are processes. Observing and accounting for patterns of continuity and change, and describing their varied pace, direction or extent, are keys to students developing an understanding of the past. Continuity and change occur across the levels of historical investigation. They may be personal, local, national or global, and social, political, cultural, economic, environmental and/or technological. Some continuities and changes are experienced differently between groups within societies. Change can occur over varying scales of time (a day, a month, a year, decades, generations or millennia), and with different orders of magnitude. Continuities in one aspect of a society may be observed at the same time change is underway in another. Students develop interpretations of continuity and change by ordering historical phenomena chronologically, using historical sources, explaining causes and consequences and establishing historical significance. Figure 3: Describing patterns of continuity and change Causes and consequences The Causes and consequences sub-strand involves students identifying long- and short-term intended and unintended causes and consequences of events by sequencing events, ideas, peoples and developments and analysing links between them. Historical inquiry involves identifying the relationship between chains of events, ideas, people and movements and their causes and consequences. Causes and consequences may be short or long term. They can stem from or affect social, political, economic, cultural, environmental and/or technological factors, and can be intended or unintended. Students identify causes and consequences to examine why things happened and their impacts. In so doing, they identify different kinds of causes and consequences, including those that are social, political or economic, and short-term triggers and long-term trends. Students develop interpretations of causes and consequences by establishing chronology, identifying continuity and change, asking questions, using historical sources and establishing historical significance. Figure 4: Causes and consequences Historical significance The Historical significance sub-strand involves students using questions and evaluative criteria to indicate relative importance of an issue, event, development, person, group, place, process, interaction or system over time and place. Historical significance is an interpretation of the importance of a historical phenomenon. It is contextual and relative. Establishing historical significance involves making evaluative judgements, informed by the evidence of historical inquiry, using criteria and questions. An individual, a group, an event, a cause, a consequence, a trend, a building or an artefact can each be historically significant. This significance is dependent on the relationship between the historical phenomenon and the historical investigation. Questions such as \u2018How important was it to people who lived at that time?\u2019, \u2018How many people were affected?\u2019, \u2018How were people\u2019s lives changed?\u2019, \u2018How long-lasting were the consequences?\u2019 or \u2018What is the event\u2019s legacy?\u2019 enable students to establish historical significance. Students establish historical significance by using evaluative criteria they develop and posing historical questions to establish the relationship of the historical phenomenon to continuity and change and/or causes and consequences. Communicating The Communicating sub-strand involves students communicating historical interpretations and arguments about the past using knowledge and evidence from historical sources in conjunction with historical concepts. History creates and conveys meaning by communicating and sharing explanations and interpretations through argument. Students use historical evidence and apply historical concepts, historical significance, continuity and change and causes and consequences to develop their interpretations of the past as part of the process of historical inquiry. The presentation of their interpretation is creative and can be expressed in written, multimodal, oral and other modes. When communicating their interpretation, students use appropriate text conventions and substantiate their evidence using referencing.", "id": "chunk_704"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Curriculum", "id": "chunk_705"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Foundation to Level 2 Band description In Foundation to Level 2, students study personal, family and local histories.

Communication in Chinese involves interaction to convey meaning as well as imagination, creativity and a broad understanding of ourselves and others. Language learning provides the opportunity for students to engage with the linguistic and cultural diversity of the world and its peoples, and to reflect on their experience in various aspects of social life, including their own participation and ways of being in the world. Learning Chinese broadens students\u2019 horizons in relation to the personal, social, cultural and employment opportunities that an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world can offer. The interdependence of countries and communities means people in all spheres of life are required to negotiate experiences and meanings across languages and cultures. A capability solely in English, despite its status as a world language, can limit global opportunities. A bilingual or plurilingual capability is the norm in many parts of the world. Learning Chinese develops learners\u2019: communication skills literacy skills in their first and additional languages intercultural capabilities understanding of, and respect for, diversity and difference, and openness to different experiences and perspectives understanding and appreciation of how culture shapes worldviews, and extends their understanding of themselves, and their own heritage, values, culture and identity critical and creative thinking. Chinese has been taught in Victorian schools since the late 1950s and at tertiary level since the 1960s. Chinese language learning experienced rapid growth in the 1980s as China undertook a policy of open-door and economic reform. Modern Standard Chinese, or Putonghua (literally \u2018the common tongue\u2019), is the official language of China. It is also referred to as Hanyu, the language of the Han people, or Zhongwen. In Taiwan it is more usually called Guoyu or Huayu. The term Huayu is also used in Singapore. The Chinese language is spoken by about a quarter of the world\u2019s population. It is the major language of communication in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, and is widely used by Chinese-speaking communities throughout the Asia-Pacific region, including Australia. Chinese is an important language for young Australians to learn as Australia continues trade and engagement in the region. Communities of Chinese speakers are characterised by linguistic, cultural and geographic diversity, and can be found in almost every country of the world. Many of these communities have long-established cultural traditions that are particularly strong on the Pacific coast of Canada and the USA, South-East Asia, Australia and some European countries. The history of the Chinese-speaking community in Victoria extends back to the mid-1800s, and patterns of migration in recent decades have seen rapid growth in Australia\u2019s Chinese population. Learning Chinese provides opportunities for students to engage socially, culturally and economically in many domains, such as business, trade, science, law, education, tourism, diplomacy, international relations, health and communications. Current links between Australia and China are characterised by bilateral relationships in trade, investment, and research and development in science and technology, as well as educational and cultural exchanges. The movement of people and ideas adds to the richness and complexity of this relationship.

Students of Chinese in Victorian schools come from a wide range of backgrounds. Some students will be learning Chinese for the first time, while others may have existing connections to Chinese through early learning experiences or as background Chinese speakers. Chinese language", "id": "chunk_761"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In this curriculum, Chinese refers to Modern Standard Chinese, Hanyu Pinyin (or Pinyin) Romanisation and simplified characters. Simplified and traditional/full-form Chinese characters are used in the media, in education and in print; therefore, some knowledge or awareness of both systems is an advantage for students of Chinese. The Chinese spoken language is composed of approximately 400 syllables, which may be used with one of 4 main tones and one neutral tone. The Pinyin system has international recognition as the principal means of representing the sounds of Chinese in the Roman alphabet. This system assists students of many language backgrounds to learn the correct sounds of Chinese, and is an efficient means of text input when creating texts in characters using digital media. It is important to note that Pinyin is not recognised as a valid alternative to written expression in characters, as its readability is limited. Chinese characters, called Hanzi, are logographs composed of a number of radicals (components) organised into a particular sequence within a square, parts of which are likely to suggest the sound and meaning of the whole character. Hanzi are morpheme-syllables: they represent a syllable of sound and a unit of meaning. There are 3500 frequently used Hanzi, which are learned by children in primary school in China. Additional characteristics of Chinese writing are that texts in Hanzi do not display word-level spacing and texts may be written and read vertically from right to left down the page. The Chinese spoken language is characterised by a high number of homophones, or tone syllables, that are used to represent more than one morpheme, each of which has its own particular character. The range of syllables in Chinese does include some unfamiliar sounds for English language speakers. The task of learning Chinese can be best addressed by a clear separation between learning to interact orally, supported by print materials in Pinyin, and learning to read and write, supported by texts and resources in Hanzi. Macro skills", "id": "chunk_762"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The macro skills of listening, speaking, reading, writing and viewing \u2013 also known as language modes \u2013 are interrelated. The learning of one skill often supports and extends the learning of others.

Teaching and learning contexts will necessarily draw from more than one of these skills to support students\u2019 effective learning. For example, students will learn new vocabulary, such as words, phrases and expressions, through listening, reading and viewing. They will apply their knowledge and understanding in their speaking and writing, as well as in their comprehension of spoken, written, viewed and multimodal texts.", "id": "chunk_763"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The macro skills are strongly aligned to all 3 strands in the Chinese curriculum (as shown in Table 2) and are implicit in the content of the sub-strands and across the content descriptions.", "id": "chunk_764"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Table 2: The relationship between macro skills and the strands within the Chinese curriculum Texts Students use a wide range of texts designed for language learning, such as textbooks, teacher-generated materials and online resources. Learning is enriched by exposure to a range of authentic Chinese texts, such as websites, films, stories, songs, television programs, advertisements and magazines. Texts can be spoken, written, viewed or multimodal, and in print or digital/online forms. They include all forms of augmentative and alternative communication; for example, gestures, real objects, photographs and images. Multimodal texts combine different modes of communication such as images and written or spoken language. Texts provide important opportunities for learning about languages and cultures. Purposeful activities can be organised around texts to meet the needs of the students in the classroom. Many of the tasks that students undertake in and out of school involve understanding and producing texts in everyday and workplace contexts. Teachers are best placed to guide the selection of texts for students to listen to, read, view, write and create. The texts and resources will become increasingly sophisticated and varied as students progress through their schooling. Teachers in government schools should refer to the Department of Education social media use policy if using social media texts, such as blogs, with students.

Communication in French involves interaction to convey meaning, as well as imagination, creativity and a broad understanding of ourselves and others. Language learning provides the opportunity for students to engage with the linguistic and cultural diversity of the world and its peoples, and to reflect on their experience in various aspects of social life, including their own participation and ways of being in the world. Learning French broadens students\u2019 horizons in relation to the personal, social, cultural and employment opportunities that an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world can offer. The interdependence of countries and communities means people in all spheres of life are required to negotiate experiences and meanings across languages and cultures. A capability solely in English, despite its status as a world language, can limit global opportunities. A bilingual or plurilingual capability is the norm in many parts of the world. Learning French develops learners\u2019: communication skills literacy skills in their first and additional languages intercultural capabilities understanding of, and respect for, diversity and difference, and openness to different experiences and perspectives understanding and appreciation of how culture shapes worldviews, and extends their understanding of themselves, and their own heritage, values, culture and identity critical and creative thinking. French has been taught in Victorian schools and universities since the 1880s. It is a major world language, spoken as the first language in more than 24 countries on 5 continents, and as an official language in many countries. First-language speakers include the inhabitants of mainland France, New Caledonia, French Polynesia, and the Wallis and Futuna Islands, the majority of the inhabitants of Quebec, and significant communities in Europe and Africa. French is widely used in diplomacy and is the official language of many international organisations. French speakers and French culture have contributed to the shaping of global movements and influenced the arts, philosophy and cultural theory, as well as fashion, design, food and wine. Learning French provides opportunities for students to engage socially, culturally and economically in many domains, such as business, trade, science, law, education, tourism, diplomacy, international relations, health and communications. Current links between Australia and the French-speaking world are strong, characterised by bilateral relationships in trade and investment, education, research and development in science and technology, humanitarian and environmental initiatives, communications, and strategic and defence priorities. The Pacific region is a particularly important focus of bilateral engagement.

Engaging with French language Developing receptive language skills in the classroom environment; exploring, noticing, listening and recognising, and then progressing to responding and using oral communication. Engaging with French culture Exploring and noticing connections between language and culture. Communicating Meaning in French This strand involves students learning to use language for communicative purposes in interpreting, creating and exchanging meaning. There are 3 sub-strands. Interacting in French Communicating and exchanging ideas, opinions, experiences, thoughts and feelings in non-verbal, spoken and written interactions; participating in planning, negotiating, deciding and taking action.

Creating text in French Creating a range of spoken and written texts for specific contexts, purposes and audiences. Understanding Language and Culture This strand involves students learning to analyse and understand language and culture as resources for interpreting and shaping meaning in intercultural exchange. There are 2 sub-strands. Understanding systems of language Understanding the linguistic features of the language, including sound, writing, and grammatical and textual conventions.

Learning in French French is pitched to second and additional language learners, who are the dominant group of French language learners in the current Australian context. Students of French in Victorian schools come from a range of backgrounds. Most students will be learning French for the first time, while some may have existing connections to French through early learning experiences or as background French speakers. French language French is an Indo-European language and belongs to the family of Romance languages derived from the spoken Latin language of the Roman Empire. It is closely related to English, owing to the shared influence of Latin. Moreover, the use of French as the official language of the English court, administration and culture for 300 years after the Norman Conquest in the 11th century contributed significantly to the development of the English language. There are more than 1700 words that are used in both languages (e.g. danger, saint, magazine, tact). This familiarity supports early stages of learning. French uses the Roman alphabet, although many of the letters are pronounced differently from English and the use of accents on some letters is an additional complexity for learners. The sound system is usually the main challenge for language learners, as it includes some novel sounds (e.g. the pronunciation of the letters r and u), letters that are silent, and unfamiliar liaisons and intonation and rhythm patterns. There are many similarities between the 2 grammatical systems, such as the same basic subject+verb+object sentence order, but also differences, such as in the use of tenses, the gendering of nouns and adjectives, the marking of plural forms of nouns and adjectives, and the use of articles and capital letters. Macro skills", "id": "chunk_830"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The macro skills of listening, speaking, reading, writing and viewing \u2013 also known as language modes \u2013 are interrelated. The learning of one skill often supports and extends the learning of others. To acknowledge these interrelationships, content in the Languages curriculums incorporates these macro skills in an integrated and interdependent way. Teaching and learning contexts will necessarily draw from more than one of these skills to support students\u2019 effective learning. For example, students will learn new vocabulary, such as words, phrases and expressions, through listening, reading and viewing. They will apply their knowledge and understanding in their speaking and writing, as well as in their comprehension of spoken, written, viewed and multimodal texts.", "id": "chunk_831"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The macro skills are strongly aligned to all 3 strands in the French curriculum (as shown in Table 2) and are implicit in the content of the sub-strands and across the content descriptions.", "id": "chunk_832"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Table 2: The relationship between macro skills and the strands within the French curriculum Texts Students use a wide range of texts designed for language learning, such as textbooks, teacher-generated materials and online resources. Learning is enriched by exposure to a range of authentic French texts, such as websites, films, stories, songs, television programs, advertisements and magazines. Texts can be spoken, written, viewed or multimodal, and in print or digital/online forms. They include all forms of augmentative and alternative communication; for example, gestures, real objects, photographs and images. Multimodal texts combine different modes of communication such as images and written or spoken language. Texts provide important opportunities for learning about languages and cultures. Purposeful activities can be organised around texts to meet the needs of the students in the classroom. Many of the tasks that students undertake in and out of school involve understanding and producing texts in everyday and workplace contexts. Teachers are best placed to guide the selection of texts for students to listen to, read, view, write and create. The texts and resources will become increasingly sophisticated and varied as students progress through their schooling. Teachers in government schools should refer to the Department of Education social media use policy if using social media texts, such as blogs, with students. Teachers in Catholic and independent schools should refer to their sector authorities for advice on social media policies.

Communication in German involves interaction to convey meaning, as well as imagination, creativity and a broad understanding of ourselves and others. Language learning provides the opportunity for students to engage with the linguistic and cultural diversity of the world and its peoples, and to reflect on their experience in various aspects of social life, including their own participation and ways of being in the world. Learning German broadens students\u2019 horizons in relation to the personal, social, cultural and employment opportunities that an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world can offer. The interdependence of countries and communities means people in all spheres of life are required to negotiate experiences and meanings across languages and cultures. A capability solely in English, despite its status as a world language, can limit global opportunities. A bilingual or plurilingual capability is the norm in many parts of the world. Learning German develops learners\u2019: communication skills literacy skills in their first and additional languages intercultural capabilities understanding of, and respect for, diversity and difference, and openness to different experiences and perspectives understanding and appreciation of how culture shapes worldviews, and extends their understanding of themselves, and their own heritage, values, culture and identity critical and creative thinking. German is the official language of Germany, Austria and Liechtenstein. It is also one of the official languages of Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and South Tyrol in Italy, as well as one of the national languages of Namibia. It is used in communities throughout the world. German is an official language of the European Union and one of the 3 procedural languages of the European Commission. The linguistic, cultural and philosophical influences of German-speaking communities can be seen in the arts, architecture, education, philosophy, food and viticulture. German speakers continue to contribute to engineering, environmental and scientific innovations, as well as recreational and sporting pursuits. German-speaking migrants have made a significant contribution to shaping multicultural Australia, and the German language has been taught in many Australian schools and universities since the mid-1800s. Strong partnerships have developed to promote relationships between Australia and German-speaking communities in Europe in educational and cultural exchanges, diplomatic and research agreements, and industry, trade and commerce. Learning German enhances students\u2019 understanding of their own language(s) and develops their appreciation of the language and cultures of German-speaking communities. Knowledge of the German language and cultures enriches travel experiences, increases employment opportunities and promotes understanding of diverse attitudes, beliefs and values. Learning German provides opportunities for students to engage socially, culturally and economically in many domains, such as business, trade, science, law, education, tourism, diplomacy, international relations, health and communications. Aims", "id": "chunk_885"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The 4 interrelated aims of the German language curriculum are to develop knowledge, understanding and skills to ensure students: communicate in German understand the relationship between language and culture develop intercultural capabilities understand themselves as communicators.

Learning in German German is pitched to second and additional language learners, who are the dominant group of German language learners in the current Australian context. Students of German in Victorian schools come from a range of backgrounds. Most students will be learning German for the first time, while some may have existing connections to German through early learning experiences or as background German speakers. German language As German and English are both derived from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family, they share many similar lexical items (cognates) and grammatical features. Consequently, speakers of English have some immediate access to spoken and written German, and from an early stage learners can engage with authentic texts. Modern German also borrows from modern English (e.g. der Computer), as does English from German (e.g. kindergarten). German is a pluricentric language with different standards and regional varieties. German is a largely phonetic language with many of the same sounds as English and the same Roman alphabet. In addition to the standard 26 letters, however, there is the use of the Umlaut (\u00c4/\u00e4, \u00d6/\u00f6 and \u00dc/\u00fc) and the Eszett or \u2018sharp S\u2019 (\u00df). A major difference in orthography that assists with the comprehensibility of written texts is the capitalisation of all nouns in German. German is well known for its morphological creativity in forming long words through compounding. There are 2 different forms of address, formal and informal, dependent on the relationship between the communicators. German speakers generally rely more heavily on the use of the imperative to effect action than speakers of Australian English, thus sometimes appearing to be more direct. Other distinctive features of German are noun gender (masculine, feminine or neuter) and the case system. Changes in the definite and indefinite articles, pronouns and adjective endings mark the 4 cases, indicating the subject, direct and indirect objects, and possession. Marking cases in this way leads to flexibility in word order, which is not possible in English. Sentences may appear long, but the case markers, along with clear and consistent punctuation rules, aid comprehension. Macro skills", "id": "chunk_897"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The macro skills of listening, speaking, reading, writing and viewing \u2013 also known as language modes \u2013 are interrelated. The learning of one skill often supports and extends the learning of others. To acknowledge these interrelationships, content in the Languages curriculums incorporates these macro skills in an integrated and interdependent way. Teaching and learning contexts will necessarily draw from more than one of these skills to support students\u2019 effective learning.

Learning is enriched by exposure to a range of authentic German texts, such as websites, films, stories, songs, television programs, advertisements and magazines. Texts can be spoken, written, viewed or multimodal, and in print or digital/online forms. They include all forms of augmentative and alternative communication; for example, gestures, real objects, photographs and images. Multimodal texts combine different modes of communication such as images and written or spoken language. Texts provide important opportunities for learning about languages and cultures. Purposeful activities can be organised around texts to meet the needs of the students in the classroom. Many of the tasks that students undertake in and out of school involve understanding and producing texts in everyday and workplace contexts. Teachers are best placed to guide the selection of texts for students to listen to, read, view, write and create. The texts and resources will become increasingly sophisticated and varied as students progress through their schooling. Teachers in government schools should refer to the Department of Education social media use policy if using social media texts, such as blogs, with students. Teachers in Catholic and independent schools should refer to their sector authorities for advice on social media policies.

Communication in Indonesian involves interaction to convey meaning, as well as imagination, creativity and a broad understanding of ourselves and others. Language learning provides the opportunity for students to engage with the linguistic and cultural diversity of the world and its peoples, and to reflect on their experience in various aspects of social life, including their own participation and ways of being in the world. Learning Indonesian broadens students\u2019 horizons in relation to the personal, social, cultural and employment opportunities that an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world can offer. The interdependence of countries and communities means people in all spheres of life are required to negotiate experiences and meanings across languages and cultures. A capability solely in English, despite its status as a world language, can limit global opportunities. A bilingual or plurilingual capability is the norm in many parts of the world. Learning Indonesian develops learners\u2019: communication skills literacy skills in their first and additional languages intercultural capabilities understanding of, and respect for, diversity and difference, and openness to different experiences and perspectives understanding and appreciation of how culture shapes worldviews, and extends their understanding of themselves, and their own heritage, values, culture and identity critical and creative thinking. Indonesian has been the official and national language of Indonesia since the country\u2019s independence. It is a language used throughout the Indonesian archipelago, which comprises over 17,000 islands. It is closely related to Malay and other variants used in Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and southern Thailand. Contact has taken place between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples of northern Australia and the peoples of the islands now known as Indonesia for several centuries, with the sharing of art, commerce, cuisine, culture and language. Indonesia is Australia\u2019s largest neighbour in the South-East Asian region of the Asia-Pacific and therefore commercial, cultural and linguistic ties continue to be of great significance between the 2 countries. Indonesian has been taught in some Australian schools and universities since the 1950s. Relations between Indonesia and Australia continue to grow in the area of education as well as trade and cultural exchanges. Australia has a strong diplomatic presence in Indonesia and significant numbers of Australians travel to Indonesia for education, business and leisure. There is an increasing number of Indonesian-speaking communities across Australia. Learning Indonesian enhances students\u2019 understanding of their own language(s) and develops their appreciation of the language and cultures of Indonesian-speaking communities. It also enriches travel experiences, increases employment opportunities, and promotes understanding of diverse attitudes, beliefs and values. Learning Indonesian provides opportunities for students to engage socially, culturally and economically in many domains, such as business, trade, science, law, education, tourism, diplomacy, international relations, health and communications.

Communicating Meaning in Indonesian This strand involves students learning to use language for communicative purposes in interpreting, creating and exchanging meaning. There are 3 sub-strands. Interacting in Indonesian Communicating and exchanging ideas, opinions, experiences, thoughts and feelings in non-verbal, spoken and written interactions; participating in planning, negotiating, deciding and taking action.

Learning in Indonesian Indonesian is pitched to second and additional language learners, who are the dominant group of Indonesian language learners in the current Australian context. Students of Indonesian in Victorian schools come from a range of backgrounds. Most students will be learning Indonesian for the first time, while some may have existing connections to Indonesian through early learning experiences or as background Indonesian speakers. Indonesian language The Indonesian language uses a Romanised script and has phonetic pronunciation, so speakers of English can predict how to say, read or write Indonesian words. It has several sounds that require learning, such as the trilled r, the \u2018ch\u2019 sound of the letter c, the combined vowel sounds ai and au, the distinction between ng and ngg, and the glottal stop k when it is a final syllable.", "id": "chunk_965"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Indonesian grammar is characterised by a system of affixation, where prefixes and suffixes attached to base words form new words belonging to different word classes or with changed grammatical function. The most common among these that are relevant to this curriculum are the noun and verb forms using the prefixes ber-, me-, pe- and ke-, and the suffixes -kan, -i and -an. There is a significant distinction between oral and written, as well as formal and informal, Indonesian. Written language, for example, follows grammatical rules of affixation, whereas spoken language often drops affixes, and vowels are often reduced to single sounds; for example, the formal hijau often appears informally as ijo. Spoken language is also frequently combined with local languages and slang forms. A major feature of Indonesian is its extensive pronoun system, which can be quite simple in its initial stages (for example, saya, Anda, kamu) but becomes increasingly complex, with multiple forms according to situations and contexts of use. In addition, the use of object-focus construction is marked, and it is frequently used in both spoken and written contexts to create distance between the agent and the action. Macro skills", "id": "chunk_966"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The macro skills of listening, speaking, reading, writing and viewing \u2013 also known as language modes \u2013 are interrelated.

Teaching and learning contexts will necessarily draw from more than one of these skills to support students\u2019 effective learning.

Learning is enriched by exposure to a range of authentic Indonesian texts, such as websites, films, stories, songs, television programs, advertisements and magazines. Texts can be spoken, written, viewed or multimodal, and in print or digital/online forms. They include all forms of augmentative and alternative communication; for example, gestures, real objects, photographs and images. Multimodal texts combine different modes of communication such as images and written or spoken language. Texts provide important opportunities for learning about languages and cultures. Purposeful activities can be organised around texts to meet the needs of the students in the classroom. Many of the tasks that students undertake in and out of school involve understanding and producing texts in everyday and workplace contexts. Teachers are best placed to guide the selection of texts for students to listen to, read, view, write and create. The texts and resources will become increasingly sophisticated and varied as students progress through their schooling. Teachers in government schools should refer to the Department of Education social media use policy if using social media texts, such as blogs, with students.

Communication in Italian involves interaction to convey meaning, as well as imagination, creativity and a broad understanding of ourselves and others. Language learning provides the opportunity for students to engage with the linguistic and cultural diversity of the world and its peoples, and to reflect on their experience in various aspects of social life, including their own participation and ways of being in the world. Learning Italian broadens students\u2019 horizons in relation to the personal, social, cultural and employment opportunities that an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world can offer. The interdependence of countries and communities means people in all spheres of life are required to negotiate experiences and meanings across languages and cultures. A capability solely in English, despite its status as a world language, can limit global opportunities. A bilingual or plurilingual capability is the norm in many parts of the world. Learning Italian develops learners\u2019: communication skills literacy skills in their first and additional languages intercultural capabilities understanding of, and respect for, diversity and difference, and openness to different experiences and perspectives understanding and appreciation of how culture shapes worldviews, and extends their understanding of themselves, and their own heritage, values, culture and identity critical and creative thinking. Italian has been taught in Victorian schools and universities since the 1930s and is one of the major community languages in Australia. It is the official language of Italy, Vatican City and San Marino, as well as one of the official languages of Switzerland and the European Union. It is a major community language in Europe, North America, South America and parts of Africa. The presence of Italian speakers in Australia can be traced back to the First Fleet in 1788 and Italian-speaking communities continue to play a significant role in Australia\u2019s culturally diverse society. Learning Italian provides opportunities for students to engage socially, culturally and economically in many domains, such as business, trade, science, law, education, tourism, diplomacy, international relations, health and communications. Australia has strong cultural, political and trade connections with Italy, including economic and commercial cooperation and expanding relationships in science and technology. Many Italian companies have branches in Australia. Italians and the Italian language make a distinctive contribution to art, architecture, cuisine, music, fashion, science, literature, film and theatre.

Learning in Italian Italian is pitched to second and additional language learners, who are the dominant group of Italian language learners in the current Australian context. Students of Italian in Victorian schools come from a wide range of backgrounds. Most students will be learning Italian for the first time, while others may have existing connections to Italian through early learning experiences or as background Italian speakers. Italian language Italian belongs to the Romance family of languages that includes Catalan, French, Portuguese, Romanian and Spanish. Italian and English have a common linguistic link with Latin, sharing many Latin-derived words and using the same Roman alphabet. The meaning of many Italian words can be instantly recognised through their similarity to English. There are points of difference between Italian and English grammars \u2013 for example, variations in word order, tense, the use of articles, and the gendering of nouns and adjectives \u2013 but overall the Italian language is not linguistically or culturally \u2018distant\u2019 for learners who speak English. It is a mostly phonetic language, pronounced generally as it is written, which is especially helpful in the development of listening and speaking skills. There is clear emphasis on all syllables, and intonation follows regular rhythms and patterns. As Italian is widely spoken in Australia, many opportunities exist to hear and use the language in real-life situations, as well as through the Italian media in Australia and in face-to-face and virtual connections with Italian communities around the world. There are also regional dialects of Italian that are used in local contexts both in Italy and beyond. Some students may bring their experience of the use of dialects to the Italian classroom.

The learning of one skill often supports and extends the learning of others. To acknowledge these interrelationships, content in the Languages curriculums incorporates these macro skills in an integrated and interdependent way. Teaching and learning contexts will necessarily draw from more than one of these skills to support students\u2019 effective learning. For example, students will learn new vocabulary, such as words, phrases and expressions, through listening, reading and viewing.

Learning is enriched by exposure to a range of authentic Italian texts, such as websites, films, stories, songs, television programs, advertisements and magazines. Texts can be spoken, written, viewed or multimodal, and in print or digital/online forms. They include all forms of augmentative and alternative communication; for example, gestures, real objects, photographs and images. Multimodal texts combine different modes of communication such as images and written or spoken language. Texts provide important opportunities for learning about languages and cultures. Purposeful activities can be organised around texts to meet the needs of the students in the classroom. Many of the tasks that students undertake in and out of school involve understanding and producing texts in everyday and workplace contexts. Teachers are best placed to guide the selection of texts for students to listen to, read, view, write and create. The texts and resources will become increasingly sophisticated and varied as students progress through their schooling. Teachers in government schools should refer to the Department of Education social media use policy if using social media texts, such as blogs, with students. Teachers in Catholic and independent schools should refer to their sector authorities for advice on social media policies.

Communication in Japanese involves interaction to convey meaning as well as imagination, creativity and a broad understanding of ourselves and others. Language learning provides the opportunity for students to engage with the linguistic and cultural diversity of the world and its peoples, and to reflect on their experience in various aspects of social life, including their own participation and ways of being in the world. Learning Japanese broadens students\u2019 horizons in relation to the personal, social, cultural and employment opportunities that an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world can offer. The interdependence of countries and communities means people in all spheres of life are required to negotiate experiences and meanings across languages and cultures. A capability solely in English, despite its status as a world language, can limit global opportunities. A bilingual or plurilingual capability is the norm in many parts of the world. Learning Japanese develops learners\u2019: communication skills literacy skills in their first and additional languages intercultural capabilities understanding of, and respect for, diversity and difference, and openness to different experiences and perspectives understanding and appreciation of how culture shapes worldviews, and extends their understanding of themselves, and their own heritage, values, culture and identity critical and creative thinking. Japanese was first taught in Victoria at tertiary level in 1919. It has been taught at school level since 1935, predominantly as a second or additional language. It is the official language of Japan and widely used by communities of speakers in Hawaii, Peru and Brazil. Large numbers of students in China, Indonesia, South Korea and Australia learn Japanese as an additional language. Victoria has an established Japanese-speaking community, and Japanese culture influences many areas of contemporary Australian society, including the arts, design, technology, fashion, popular culture, sport and cuisine. Australia is a close strategic and economic partner of Japan, and there is ongoing exchange between the 2 countries. Learning Japanese provides opportunities for students to engage socially, culturally and economically in many domains, such as business, trade, science, law, education, tourism, diplomacy, international relations, health and communications. Japan is an important nation within the Asia-Pacific and a significant contributor to economic, cultural and diplomatic relations in the region.

Learning in Japanese Japanese is pitched to second and additional language learners, who are the dominant group of Japanese language learners in the current Australian context. Students of Japanese in Victorian schools come from a wide range of backgrounds. Most students will be learning Japanese for the first time, while others may have existing connections to Japanese through early learning experiences or as background Japanese speakers. Japanese language Japanese is a phonetic language. Japanese pronunciation follows consistent rules and is predictable. Japanese uses 3 scripts for writing: Hiragana, the basic phonetic script representing the sounds of Japanese; Katakana, the companion phonetic script that is used predominantly for loan words; and Kanji, Chinese characters that represent meaning rather than sound (ideographs). The 3 scripts are used interdependently. Students first experience written Japanese by learning to recognise some simple Kanji that represent introductory topics such as numbers, as well as pictographic concepts such as mountain, river or tree. Hiragana is typically the first script that students learn to write. Selected Katakana and Kanji are introduced in context, then taught systematically, contributing to script knowledge and competence. Many loan words from other languages expressed in Katakana reflect the impact of globalisation, technology and popular culture on Japanese language and culture. Japanese grammar is relatively uniform, with few irregularities, no grammatical gender, and predictable and systematic conjugation of adjectives and verbs. There are some differences such as word order between Japanese (subject+object+verb/copula) and English (subject+verb+object). Sentences can be enhanced by the addition of details such as adjectives, adjectival nouns or relative clauses, usually placed before the main items. As the Japanese language is highly contextual, it is not always necessary to articulate the subject, direct object or indirect object of a sentence, and pronouns are not used as frequently as in English. Japanese expresses the plural very differently to English, and counting involves using counter classifiers that reflect the nature of the item. Japanese also uses particles, which are short words that identify the grammatical function of words in a sentence. An element of Japanese that may be unfamiliar to some learners is the system of plain and polite forms of language, which reflect respect, status, positioning and hierarchy in social and professional relationships. Plain and polite forms are represented in both spoken and written language. For example, there are shortened sentences, abbreviated plain forms and some omitted particles in informal conversations. In writing, plain form does not only denote \u2018impolite\u2019 or \u2018informal\u2019 language, but is the accepted form for a number of text types such as picture books, diary or journal entries, social media posts and newspaper articles. Macro skills", "id": "chunk_1102"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The macro skills of listening, speaking, reading, writing and viewing \u2013 also known as language modes \u2013 are interrelated.

Teaching and learning contexts will necessarily draw from more than one of these skills to support students\u2019 effective learning.

Learning is enriched by exposure to a range of authentic Japanese texts, such as websites, films, stories, songs, television programs, advertisements and magazines. Texts can be spoken, written, viewed or multimodal, and in print or digital/online forms. They include all forms of augmentative and alternative communication; for example, gestures, real objects, photographs and images. Multimodal texts combine different modes of communication such as images and written or spoken language. Texts provide important opportunities for learning about languages and cultures. Purposeful activities can be organised around texts to meet the needs of the students in the classroom. Many of the tasks that students undertake in and out of school involve understanding and producing texts in everyday and workplace contexts. Teachers are best placed to guide the selection of texts for students to listen to, read, view, write and create. The texts and resources will become increasingly sophisticated and varied as students progress through their schooling. Teachers in government schools should refer to the Department of Education social media use policy if using social media texts, such as blogs, with students. Teachers in Catholic and independent schools should refer to their sector authorities for advice on social media policies.

Communication in Korean involves interaction to convey meaning, as well as imagination, creativity and a broad understanding of ourselves and others. Language learning provides the opportunity for students to engage with the linguistic and cultural diversity of the world and its peoples, and to reflect on their experience in various aspects of social life, including their own participation and ways of being in the world. Learning Korean broadens students\u2019 horizons in relation to the personal, social, cultural and employment opportunities that an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world can offer. The interdependence of countries and communities means people in all spheres of life are required to negotiate experiences and meanings across languages and cultures. A capability solely in English, despite its status as a world language, can limit global opportunities. A bilingual or plurilingual capability is the norm in many parts of the world. Learning Korean develops learners\u2019: communication skills literacy skills in their first and additional languages intercultural capabilities understanding of, and respect for, diversity and difference, and openness to different experiences and perspectives understanding and appreciation of how culture shapes worldviews, and extends their understanding of themselves, and their own heritage, values, culture and identity critical and creative thinking. Korean is the official language of South Korea (Republic of Korea) and North Korea (Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea) and is spoken in communities worldwide. South Korea is one of the most technologically advanced societies and economies in the Asian region. It is developing global reach with its innovation of high-tech products and vehicles, and popular culture. South Korea and Australia have established relationships through cultural and educational exchanges, and economic, political and trade partnerships. Korean migration has made a significant contribution in shaping multicultural Australia. There have been an increasing number of Korean-speaking communities established throughout Australia since the late 1960s. Korean language has been taught in Victorian schools and universities since the early 1990s. The influences of and interest in Korean cuisine, as well as popular culture, such as K-pop, cosmetics, films and television shows, are increasingly evident in Australian society. Learning Korean enhances students\u2019 understanding of different alphabets and writing systems, and their own language(s), and develops an appreciation of the language and cultures of Korean-speaking communities. It also enriches travel experiences, increases employment opportunities, and promotes understanding of diverse attitudes, beliefs and values. Learning Korean provides opportunities for students to engage socially, culturally and economically in many domains, such as business, trade, science, law, education, tourism, diplomacy, international relations, health and communications. Aims", "id": "chunk_1157"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The 4 interrelated aims of the Korean language curriculum are to develop knowledge, understanding and skills to ensure students: communicate in Korean understand the relationship between language and culture develop intercultural capabilities understand themselves as communicators.

Learning in Korean Korean is pitched to second and additional language learners, who are the dominant group of Korean language learners in the current Australian context. Students of Korean in Victorian schools come from a range of backgrounds. Most students will be learning Korean for the first time, while some may have existing connections to Korean through early learning experiences or as background Korean speakers. Korean language Korean is a phonetic language that has its own alphabetic writing system called Hangeul. Hangeul consists of 24 basic letters, comprising 14 consonants and 10 vowels, which are combined to form sounds. Hangeul letters are grouped into syllable blocks, with each block typically representing a single syllable. Each syllable block is composed of at least one consonant and one vowel, arranged in a specific manner. Hangeul was created by King Sejong the Great, based on philosophical principles. In forming the vowels, the 3 elements of\u00a0Heaven (\u2022),\u00a0Earth (\u3161), and\u00a0Human (\u3163)\u00a0are combined. Additionally, the consonants in Hangeul are designed to represent the shape of the speech organs used to produce each sound, such as lips, teeth, tongue and throat. Korean syntax follows a subject+object+verb (SOV) order; however, the order can be flexible if the verb-final rule is observed, and contextually understood elements may be left unexpressed in Korean discourse.\u00a0Various particles or suffixes are attached to nominals or verb stems to express a range of grammatical, semantic or pragmatic information. Korean also incorporates many loan words. These words are adapted to fit Korean phonology and are often written in Hangeul. Students learn about Korean culture, as well as how to use the language in culturally appropriate ways. Honorifics are one of the important features of Korean. Students learn how to express their thoughts with cultural bearing through the systematic use of honorifics and through non-verbal behaviour that corresponds to the chosen honorific. Macro skills", "id": "chunk_1169"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The macro skills of listening, speaking, reading, writing and viewing \u2013 also known as language modes \u2013 are interrelated. The learning of one skill often supports and extends the learning of others.

Learning is enriched by exposure to a range of authentic Korean texts, such as websites, films, stories, songs, television programs, advertisements and magazines. Texts can be spoken, written, viewed or multimodal, and in print or digital/online forms. They include all forms of augmentative and alternative communication; for example, gestures, real objects, photographs and images. Multimodal texts combine different modes of communication such as images and written or spoken language. Texts provide important opportunities for learning about languages and cultures. Purposeful activities can be organised around texts to meet the needs of the students in the classroom. Many of the tasks that students undertake in and out of school involve understanding and producing texts in everyday and workplace contexts. Teachers are best placed to guide the selection of texts for students to listen to, read, view, write and create. The texts and resources will become increasingly sophisticated and varied as students progress through their schooling. Teachers in government schools should refer to the Department of Education social media use policy if using social media texts, such as blogs, with students. Teachers in Catholic and independent schools should refer to their sector authorities for advice on social media policies.

Communication in Modern Greek involves interaction to convey meaning, as well as imagination, creativity and a broad understanding of ourselves and others. Language learning provides the opportunity for students to engage with the linguistic and cultural diversity of the world and its peoples, and to reflect on their experience in various aspects of social life, including their own participation and ways of being in the world. Learning Modern Greek broadens students\u2019 horizons in relation to the personal, social, cultural and employment opportunities that an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world can offer. The interdependence of countries and communities means people in all spheres of life are required to negotiate experiences and meanings across languages and cultures. A capability solely in English, despite its status as a world language, can limit global opportunities. A bilingual or plurilingual capability is the norm in many parts of the world. Learning Modern Greek develops learners\u2019: communication skills literacy skills in their first and additional languages intercultural capabilities understanding of, and respect for, diversity and difference, and openness to different experiences and perspectives understanding and appreciation of how culture shapes worldviews, and extends their understanding of themselves, and their own heritage, values, culture and identity critical and creative thinking. Modern Greek is the official language of Greece and an official language of the Republic of Cyprus. It is spoken in communities throughout the world. The modern standard version of Greek is the Demotic form of the spoken and written language, and is the official language taught worldwide. Greek is one of the official languages of the European Union. The Hellenic civilisation and language have significantly shaped Western civilisation in the arts, architecture, literature, medicine, mathematics, philosophy, politics and science. The Greek language is still used in many fields to coin new terms. Greek migration has made a significant contribution to shaping multicultural Australia. In Victoria, there is a large and vibrant Greek-speaking community. The Greek language has been taught widely in Victorian schools and universities since the 1970s, although extensive networks of community language programs commenced prior to this time with the establishment of the Greek-speaking community in Victoria. The influence of Greek-speaking communities in Australia is evident in the areas of agriculture, the arts, commerce and trade, cuisine, education, government and politics, industry, law, medicine and scientific research. Modern Greek and English belong to different branches of the Indo-European language family. Both languages share some similarities such as vocabulary, and language structures and features. Learning Modern Greek enhances students\u2019 understanding of the origins of many English words, and supports awareness of different alphabets and writing systems. Students develop an appreciation of the language and cultures of Greek-speaking communities. It also enriches travel experiences, increases employment opportunities and promotes understanding of diverse attitudes, beliefs and values. Learning Greek provides opportunities for students to engage socially, culturally and economically in many domains, such as business, trade, science, law, education, tourism, diplomacy, international relations, health and communications.

Learning in Modern Greek Modern Greek is pitched to second and additional language learners, who are the dominant group of Greek language learners in the current Australian context. Students of Modern Greek in Victorian schools come from a range of backgrounds. Most students will be learning the language for the first time, while some may have existing connections to Greek through early learning experiences or as background speakers. Greek language Standard Modern Greek, or \u039d\u03ad\u03b1 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac (Neoelliniki, literally \u2018Modern Greek\u2019), is an alphabetic (non-Roman) language, with 24 letters, and has remained relatively unchanged since ancient times. It is a phonetic language, with a simple form of accentuation and highly structured grammar and syntax. Although many English words are derived from Greek, the language structure is very different. There are, for example, marked differences in the use of articles, gender agreement for adjectives and nouns, verb conjugations, declensions of nouns and variations in word order. These distinctive features influence how Modern Greek is taught in the classroom. They will be seen through the key text types and processes chosen as a vehicle to develop learners\u2019 understanding of them and in the context for interactions through which learners will develop the skills for their sustained use. Macro skills", "id": "chunk_1236"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The macro skills of listening, speaking, reading, writing and viewing \u2013 also known as language modes \u2013 are interrelated.

Teaching and learning contexts will necessarily draw from more than one of these skills to support students\u2019 effective learning.

Learning is enriched by exposure to a range of authentic Greek texts, such as websites, films, stories, songs, television programs, advertisements and magazines. Texts can be spoken, written, viewed or multimodal, and in print or digital/online forms. They include all forms of augmentative and alternative communication; for example, gestures, real objects, photographs and images. Multimodal texts combine different modes of communication such as images and written or spoken language. Texts provide important opportunities for learning about languages and cultures. Purposeful activities can be organised around texts to meet the needs of the students in the classroom. Many of the tasks that students undertake in and out of school involve understanding and producing texts in everyday and workplace contexts. Teachers are best placed to guide the selection of texts for students to listen to, read, view, write and create. The texts and resources will become increasingly sophisticated and varied as students progress through their schooling. Teachers in government schools should refer to the Department of Education social media use policy if using social media texts, such as blogs, with students. Teachers in Catholic and independent schools should refer to their sector authorities for advice on social media policies.

Communication in Spanish involves interaction to convey meaning, as well as imagination, creativity and a broad understanding of ourselves and others. Language learning provides the opportunity for students to engage with the linguistic and cultural diversity of the world and its peoples, and to reflect on their experience in various aspects of social life, including their own participation and ways of being in the world. Learning Spanish broadens students\u2019 horizons in relation to the personal, social, cultural and employment opportunities that an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world can offer. The interdependence of countries and communities means people in all spheres of life are required to negotiate experiences and meanings across languages and cultures. A capability solely in English, despite its status as a world language, can limit global opportunities. A bilingual or plurilingual capability is the norm in many parts of the world. Learning Spanish develops learners\u2019: communication skills literacy skills in their first and additional languages intercultural capabilities understanding of, and respect for, diversity and difference, and openness to different experiences and perspectives understanding and appreciation of how culture shapes worldviews, and extends their understanding of themselves, and their own heritage, values, culture and identity critical and creative thinking. Spanish is the official language of Spain and an official language in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Uruguay and Venezuela. It is also one of the official languages of the European Union and the United Nations. Spanish is widely spoken in communities throughout the world, including Andorra, Belize, Gibraltar and the United States. Usage of the Spanish language naturally varies across countries and communities; these regional differences make the language richer. The ongoing linguistic and cultural influence of Spanish-speaking communities can be seen globally in areas such as architecture, film, art, cuisine, dance, literature and music. This influence is evident in Australian society today. Spanish-speaking migrants have made a significant contribution to shaping multicultural Australia. Their patterns of migration have been influenced by a variety of factors, including economic and political circumstances, interest in tertiary education, and employment opportunities presented by trade agreements in sectors such as agriculture, mining and technology. The Spanish language has been taught in Victorian schools and universities since the 1970s. Learning Spanish enhances students\u2019 understanding of their own language(s) and develops their appreciation of the language and cultures of Spanish-speaking communities. It also enriches travel experiences, increases employment opportunities and promotes understanding of diverse attitudes, beliefs and values. Learning Spanish provides opportunities for students to engage socially, culturally and economically in many domains, such as business, trade, science, law, education, tourism, diplomacy, international relations, health and communications.

Learning in Spanish Learning in Spanish is pitched to second and additional language learners, who are the dominant group of Spanish language learners in the current Australian context. Students of Spanish in Victorian schools come from a range of backgrounds. Most students will be learning Spanish for the first time, while some may have existing connections to Spanish through early learning experiences or as background Spanish speakers. Students who bring prior knowledge of Spanish to the classroom may have experience of regional variations of Spanish, or may speak several languages at home. Spanish language As both Spanish and English belong to the Indo-European family of languages, they share many similarities such as alphabet, vocabulary, and language structures and features. Knowledge of Spanish can also facilitate the learning of other Romance languages, derived from Latin, such as Portuguese, French, Italian, Romanian, Catalan and Galician. Because Spanish is used so widely around the world, there are phonetic, morphological, syntactic and semantic variations in the use of Spanish across regions. Distinctive characteristics and features of the Spanish language guide the teaching and learning of the language in schools. The close correspondence between the written and spoken forms of Spanish assists with spelling and the development of literacy in general, as well as with speaking and listening skills. Although the Spanish alphabet and writing system are similar to those of English, there are some differences that may be unfamiliar to some learners, such as the use of accents, inverted question and exclamation marks at the beginning of questions and exclamations, respectively, and the distinctive letter \u00f1. Word order in Spanish differs from English, most noticeably in the positioning of adjectives after nouns. Other fundamental differences from English are the grammatical gender of nouns, and the gender and number agreement between nouns, articles and adjectives. Subject pronouns that are required in English are often omitted in Spanish. Intonation and stress are important for making meaning, as it is not necessary to invert the subject and the verb to form a question, or to use auxiliary verbs in negative and interrogative constructions. Macro skills", "id": "chunk_1304"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The macro skills of listening, speaking, reading, writing and viewing \u2013 also known as language modes \u2013 are interrelated. The learning of one skill often supports and extends the learning of others. To acknowledge these interrelationships, content in the Languages curriculums incorporates these macro skills in an integrated and interdependent way. Teaching and learning contexts will necessarily draw from more than one of these skills to support students\u2019 effective learning.

Learning is enriched by exposure to a range of authentic Spanish texts, such as websites, films, stories, songs, television programs, advertisements and magazines. Texts can be spoken, written, viewed or multimodal, and in print or digital/online forms. They include all forms of augmentative and alternative communication; for example, gestures, real objects, photographs and images. Multimodal texts combine different modes of communication such as images and written or spoken language. Texts provide important opportunities for learning about languages and cultures. Purposeful activities can be organised around texts to meet the needs of the students in the classroom. Many of the tasks that students undertake in and out of school involve understanding and producing texts in everyday and workplace contexts. Teachers are best placed to guide the selection of texts for students to listen to, read, view, write and create. The texts and resources will become increasingly sophisticated and varied as students progress through their schooling. Teachers in government schools should refer to the Department of Education social media use policy if using social media texts, such as blogs, with students. Teachers in Catholic and independent schools should refer to their sector authorities for advice on social media policies.

In the early stages, the focus is on engagement through imagination and play-based learning. Students first engage with the language and culture through listening, speaking and action-related learning activities. They participate in shared listening and viewing of multimodal texts that reflect the language and cultures of Spanish-speaking communities. Students learn to communicate with others, and a focus on play is a strong feature throughout this band. They imitate the sounds, shapes and patterns of spoken Spanish, and receive extensive support through modelling, scaffolding and revisiting their learning as their understanding develops. Learners explore the written language, beginning with reading a variety of texts and progressing to creating their own texts about their personal world as they develop their linguistic skills. Through engaging with texts of increasing depth and complexity, students are given opportunities to expand their linguistic repertoire.

They recognise that Spanish sounds are represented by letters, and they can match these with words, combining them in increasingly complex ways. They develop and expand their vocabulary, from simple sounds to frequently used words and phrases, using the pronunciation and intonation patterns of spoken Spanish. They expand their repertoire of Spanish words and phrases through listening and reading, and then progress to creating simple sentences and responses using modelled language. Students identify familiar words and phrases to obtain meaning from a variety of multimodal texts relating to their personal world. They begin to explain their understanding of the features and grammatical structures of Spanish using simple metalanguage. They start to develop written competence by copying letters and words, and then produce the language with support. They respond to texts using frequently used words, phrases and sentence patterns in both written and spoken language. They apply their understanding of some of the conventions and features of the written Spanish language.

For example, in Science, understanding sources of error and their impact on the confidence of conclusions is vital; in Geography, interpretation of data underpins the study of human populations and their physical environments\u037e in History, students need to be able to imagine timelines and time frames to reconcile related events\u037e and in English, deriving quantitative, logical and spatial information is an important aspect of making meaning of texts. Mathematical ideas have evolved across cultures over thousands of years and are continually developing. The modern world is influenced by ever-expanding computational power, digital systems, automation, artificial intelligence, economics and data-driven societies. This leads to the need for a capable science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce. Mathematics is integral to quantifying, thinking critically and making sense of the world. It is central to building students\u2019 pattern recognition, visualisation, spatial reasoning and logical thinking. Interdisciplinary STEM learning can enhance students\u2019 scientific and mathematical literacy, design and computational thinking, problem-solving and collaboration skills. Developing these competencies supports students in pursuing a variety of careers and occupations within STEM and other fields. Mathematics provides opportunities for students to apply their mathematical knowledge creatively and efficiently, sharpen their sense of discovery and develop an appreciation of structure. It enables teachers to help students to become self-motivated, confident learners through practice, inquiry and active participation in relevant and challenging experiences. Aims Mathematics aims to ensure that students: develop useful mathematical and numeracy skills for everyday life and work, as active and critical citizens in a technological world become confident, proficient, effective and adaptive users of mathematics become effective communicators of mathematics who can investigate, represent and interpret situations in their personal and work lives, think critically, and make choices as active, engaged, numerate citizens develop proficiency with mathematical concepts, skills, procedures and processes, and use them to demonstrate mastery in mathematics as they pose and solve problems, and reason with number, algebra, measurement, space, statistics and probability make connections between areas of mathematics and apply mathematics to model situations in various fields and disciplines develop a positive disposition towards mathematics, recognising it as an accessible and useful discipline to study appreciate mathematics as a discipline \u2013 its history, ideas, problems and applications, aesthetics and philosophy.

Strands", "id": "chunk_1373"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The curriculum is organised into 6 interrelated strands. The strands group the content descriptions, to provide both a focus and a clear sequence for the development of related concepts and skills across levels. The 6 strands are: Number Algebra Measurement Space Statistics (commencing at Foundation Level C) Probability (commencing at Level 3).", "id": "chunk_1374"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "An expectation of mathematical proficiency has been embedded into curriculum content across all strands to ensure that students develop mastery in mathematics through the development and application of increasingly sophisticated and refined mathematical understanding and fluency, reasoning and problem-solving skills. The concepts, skills, procedures and processes essential to the learning of mathematics are organised under the 6 interrelated strands, in a sequence of development that increases in depth and breadth across the years of schooling. Natural connections exist between the content of these strands; for example, Number and Algebra build on an understanding of number systems and the properties of operations to describe relationships and formulate generalisations. Statistics and Probability have strong connections that rely on and build on the important links between them. Measurement relates not only to Space but is also foundational to all strands, enhancing their practical relevance. Combined with Number, it provides a means to quantify, compare, communicate and make sense of situations where metrics may provide insight. It is important that students develop the capability to identify and use the many connections that exist within and across the strands of Mathematics. The 6 strands also specify content aimed at progressively developing students\u2019 knowledge and use of mathematical, statistical and computational thinking through the processes of mathematical modelling, computational thinking, statistical investigation, probability experiments and simulations. When students are actively engaged in learning experiences involving the mathematical processes, they draw on and further develop their mathematical understanding, fluency, reasoning and problem-solving skills in an integrated way. Number The Number strand develops ways of working with mental constructs that deal with correspondence, magnitude and order, for which operations and their properties can be defined. Numbers have wide-ranging application and specific uses in counting, measuring and other means of quantifying situations and objects. Number systems are constructed to deal with different contexts and problems involving finite and infinite, and discrete and continuous sets. Students apply number sense and strategies for counting and representing numbers as they explore the magnitude and properties of numbers, apply a range of strategies for computation and understand the connections between operations. Developing number sense and the ability to work effectively with numbers is critical to being an active and productive citizen who is successful at work and in future learning, who is financially literate, and who engages with the world and other individuals. Algebra The Algebra strand develops ways of using symbols and symbolic representations to think and reason about relationships in both mathematical and real-world contexts. It provides a means for manipulating mathematical objects, recognising patterns and structures, making connections, understanding properties of operations and the concept of equivalence, abstracting information, working with variables, solving equations and generalising number and operation facts and relationships. Algebra connects symbolic, graphic and numeric representations. Students recognise patterns and understand the concepts of variable and function as they build on their understanding of the number system to describe relationships, formulate generalisations, recognise equivalence, and solve equations and inequalities. Algebra deals with situations of generality, communicating abstract ideas applied in areas such as science, health, finance, sport, engineering, and building and construction. Measurement The Measurement strand develops ways of quantifying aspects of the human and physical world. Measures and units are defined and selected to be relevant and appropriate to the context. Measurement is used to answer questions, show results, demonstrate value, justify allocation of resources, evaluate performance, identify opportunities for improvement and manage results. Students develop an increasingly sophisticated understanding of size, shape, relative position and movement of two-dimensional figures in the plane and three-dimensional objects in space. They make meaningful measurements of quantities, choosing appropriate metric units of measurement. They build an understanding of the connections between units and calculate derived measures such as area, speed and density. Measurement underpins understanding, comparison and decision-making in many personal, societal, environmental, agricultural, industrial, spatial, health and economic contexts. Space The Space strand develops ways of visualising, representing and working with the location, direction, shape, placement, proximity and transformation of objects at macro, local and micro scales in natural and constructed worlds. It underpins students\u2019 capacity to make pictures, diagrams, maps, projections, networks, models and graphics that enable the manipulation and analysis of shapes and objects through actions and the senses. This includes notions such as surface, region, boundary, curve, object, dimension, connectedness, symmetry, direction, congruence and similarity. Students investigate properties and apply their understanding of them to define, compare and construct figures and objects as they learn to develop geometric arguments. These notions apply to art, design, architecture, planning, transportation, construction and manufacturing, physics, engineering, chemistry, biology and medicine. Statistics The Statistics strand develops ways of collecting, understanding and describing data and its distribution. Statistics provides a story, or a means to support or question an argument, and enables exploratory data analysis that underpins decision-making and informed judgement. Statistical literacy requires an understanding of statistical information and processes, including an awareness of data and the ability to estimate, interpret, evaluate and communicate with respect to variation in the real world. Statistical literacy provides a basis for critical scrutiny of an argument, the accuracy of representations, and the validity and reliability of inferences and claims. The effective use of data requires acknowledging and expecting variation in the collection, analysis and interpretation of data arising for categorical and numerical variables. Students recognise and analyse data and draw inferences. They represent, summarise and interpret data and undertake purposeful investigations involving the collection and interpretation of data, as well as building skills to critically evaluate statistical information and develop intuitions about data. Statistics is used in business, government, research, sport, health care and media for critical and informed evaluation of issues, arguments and decision-making. Probability The Probability strand develops ways of dealing with uncertainty and expectation, making predictions, and characterising the chance of events, or how likely events are to occur from both empirical and theoretical bases. It provides a means of considering, analysing and utilising the chance of events, and recognising random phenomena for which it is impossible to exactly determine the next observed outcome before it occurs. In contexts where chance plays a role, probability provides experimental and theoretical ways to quantify how likely it is that a particular event will occur, or how likely it is that a proposition is the case. This enables students to understand contexts involving chance and to build mathematical models surrounding risk and decision-making in a range of areas of human endeavour. These include finance, science, business management, epidemiology, games of chance, computer science and artificial intelligence. Students recognise variation, assess likelihood and assign probabilities using experimental and theoretical approaches.", "id": "chunk_1375"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards", "id": "chunk_1376"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards describe what students are typically able to understand and do, and they are the basis for reporting student achievement.", "id": "chunk_1377"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Students\u2019 mastery of concepts under the 6 strands is indicated by their ability to demonstrate proficiency against the achievement standards.

They are provided as advisory material only and are not mandated. Learning in Mathematics Learning in Mathematics emphasises the importance of providing opportunities for students to develop proficiency in mathematics. This development of proficiency is achieved in how content is explored or developed, that is, how students experience the thinking and doing of mathematics. Proficiency in Mathematics The proficiencies of Understanding, Fluency, Reasoning and Problem-solving are embedded in all 6 strands and further the development of increasingly sophisticated knowledge and understanding of mathematical concepts, fluency in representations and procedures, and sound mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Proficiency in mathematics enables students to respond to familiar and unfamiliar situations by employing mathematical processes to solve problems efficiently and to make informed decisions. Proficiency in mathematics also enables students to reflect on and evaluate approaches, and verify that answers and results are reasonable in the context. Understanding Mathematics provides opportunities for students to build and refine a robust knowledge of adaptable and transferable mathematical concepts, structures and procedures. Students make connections between related ideas, progressively draw on their reasoning skills to adapt and transfer understanding of familiar applications to unfamiliar contexts, and cultivate new ideas. They develop an understanding of the relationship between the \u2018why\u2019 and the \u2018how\u2019 of mathematics. Students build conceptual understanding and procedural fluency when they connect related ideas, represent concepts in different ways, identify commonalities and differences between aspects of content, describe their thinking mathematically and interpret mathematical information. Fluency Mathematics provides opportunities for students to develop, practise and consolidate skills; choose appropriate procedures; carry out procedures flexibly, accurately, efficiently and appropriately; and apply their recall of factual knowledge and understanding of concepts readily. Students are fluent when they connect their conceptual understanding to learned strategies and procedures, make reasonable estimates and calculate answers efficiently, and choose and use computational strategies efficiently; when they recognise robust or multiple ways of answering questions; when they choose appropriate representations and approximations; when they understand and regularly apply definitions, facts and theorems; and when they can manipulate mathematical objects, expressions, relations and equations to find solutions to problems. Reasoning Mathematics emphasises mathematical reasoning as central to thinking and working mathematically and as a critical component of proficiency in mathematics. Mathematical reasoning guides students in developing an increasingly sophisticated capacity for logical thought and actions, such as conjecturing, hypothesising, analysing, proving, experimenting, modelling, evaluating, explaining, inferring, justifying, refuting, abstracting and generalising. Students are reasoning mathematically when they explain their thinking, deduce and justify strategies used and conclusions reached, adapt the known to the unknown, transfer learning from one context to another, make inferences about data or the likelihood of events, and prove that something is true or false. They are reasoning when they compare and contrast related ideas, and reflect on and explain their choices. Problem-solving Mathematics recognises the importance of providing students with meaningful opportunities to use mathematics to solve problems from both abstract mathematical and real-world contexts. Students engage in mathematical problem-solving when they are presented with a problem situation for which they do not immediately know the answer, and they work through a process of planning, choosing and applying strategies and heuristics to find a solution to the problem, reviewing and analysing their solution. Problems can be simple, where there is only one possible solution, or complicated, where the problem may have many valid approaches to develop solutions. Problem-solving is the ability of students to make choices, interpret, formulate, model and investigate problem situations mathematically, select and use technological functions and communicate solutions effectively. Students pose and solve problems when they use mathematics to represent unfamiliar or meaningful situations, design investigations and plan their approaches, make mathematical decisions as they draw on previously learnt concepts, skills, procedures and processes to solve problems, verify that their answers are reasonable, communicate solutions clearly and justify the reasonableness of their approaches. Mathematical processes Mathematical processes refer to the thinking, reasoning, communicating, problem-solving and investigation skills involved in working mathematically. Opportunities to learn process skills have been embedded across the strands, building in sophistication across the levels. Mathematical problem-solving and investigation draws on the processes of mathematical modelling, computational and algorithmic thinking, statistical investigation, probability experiments and simulations. Mathematical modelling Mathematical models are used to gain insight into and make predictions about real-world phenomena, to inform judgements and make decisions in personal, civic and work life. In the modelling process students formulate a real-world problem mathematically by making assumptions; recognise, connect and apply mathematical structures; analyse and solve the mathematical model; and interpret, generalise and communicate their results in response to the real-world situation. Mathematical modelling is an essential dimension of the contemporary discipline of mathematics and is key to informed and participatory citizenship. Computational thinking and simulations Students develop computational thinking through the application of its various components: decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition, use of models and simulations, algorithms and generalisation. Computational thinking approaches involve experimental and logical analysis, empirical reasoning and computer-based simulations. The simulations can then be used to generate and test hypotheses and conjectures, identify patterns and key features (or counterexamples), and dynamically explore variation in the behaviour of structures, systems and scenarios. Statistical investigation Students develop the ability to conduct statistical investigations through informal exploration in the early levels. Later they use guided processes, which progressively lead them to conduct and review their own statistical investigations and to critique others\u2019 processes and conclusions. Statistical investigation deals with uncertainty and variability in categorical (nominal or ordinal) or numerical (discrete or continuous) data arising from observations, surveys or experiments and can be initiated by a specific question, a situation or an issue. Probability experiments and simulations Students develop an understanding of experimentation through exploration and play-based learning in the early levels. They progress to conducting chance experiments and probability simulations from Level 3 onwards. Experimentation and simulation in mathematics can involve the use of digital and other tools, often to generate large sets of data for consideration, drawing on the interconnections between Statistics and Probability. Experimenting in mathematics requires students to plan what to do and evaluate what they find out using mathematical reasoning. Computation, algorithms and the use of digital tools in mathematics", "id": "chunk_1382"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The capacity to purposefully select and effectively use the functionality of a digital device, platform, software or digital resource is a key aspect of engaging with computational thinking in the Mathematics curriculum. Digital tools can be used effectively to learn and apply mathematics in and across all of the strands. The use of digital tools addresses elements of the Digital Literacy capability. The functionalities may be accessed through hand-held devices such as calculators (arithmetic four operation, scientific, graphics, financial, CAS) and measurement tools (digital scales and other digital measuring devices), software on a computer or tablet (spreadsheet, dynamic geometry, statistical, financial, graphing, computer-algebra), an application on a personal device, virtual and augmented reality technologies or tools accessed from the internet or cloud. Different digital tools or platforms can carry out computations and implement algorithms using numerical, textual, statistical, probabilistic, financial, measurement, geometrical, graphical, logical and symbolic functionalities. The term \u2018computation\u2019 is used in mathematics to refer to arithmetic and non-arithmetic calculations, operations, transformations, procedures and processes that are applied to mathematical objects to produce an output or result. A computation may be an arithmetic calculation; running an algorithm; applying transformations to the graph of a relation, function, network or set of data; developing a set, list, sequence or table of values from a rule; developing a diagram or shape; or the evaluation of an algebraic equation. The objects of computations may be sets of numbers, text, data, points, shapes and objects in space, images, diagrams, networks, or symbolic and logical expressions, including equations. Some computations may be dynamic; that is, they enable parameters, conditions and constraints to be varied and the corresponding results to be progressively shown. Examples include the effect of varying an outlier on the mean of a data set, the behaviour of an algorithm under a different set of inputs, sorting or ordering the elements of a set, observing the relative frequency of an event as the number of experiments increases, manipulating a shape in 2 dimensions or an object in 3 dimensions and observing any symmetries, or transforming the graph of a function by varying defining parameters, such as changing the gradient of a linear function. An algorithm is a precise description of efficient steps and decisions needed to carry out a computation, or a set of rules to follow in order to accomplish a task. Algorithms often involve iterative (repetitive) and recursive (repeatedly applied) processes and can be represented as text, in diagrams or symbolically as flow charts or pseudocode. As students develop a conceptual understanding of how an algorithm works and fluency with using algorithms appropriately, they can reason and solve problems using algorithms as part of a computational thinking process.

Together, the 3 strands provide students with understanding, knowledge and skills through which they can develop a scientific view of the world. Students are challenged to explore science and its concepts, nature and uses through clearly described inquiry practices. Content under each strand is further organised into sub-strands, as shown below. Science as a Human Endeavour In this strand, students learn about the nature of science, including the role of scientific inquiry in developing scientific knowledge, and the factors that affect the use and advancement of science. Students learn that, through science, we seek to improve our understanding of and explanations for the world, and that we refine and revise scientific knowledge as new evidence becomes available. They appreciate that science influences society when scientists pose and respond to ethical, environmental and social questions, and that individual and collective scientific research is itself influenced by the needs and priorities of society. This strand highlights the development of science as a unique way of knowing and doing, and the role of science in contemporary decision-making and problem-solving. The Science as a Human Endeavour strand comprises the following 2 sub-strands. Nature and development of science Students develop an appreciation of the unique nature of science and scientific knowledge, including that scientific knowledge is based on empirical evidence and can be modified in light of new or reinterpreted evidence. They explore historical and global contributions to scientific knowledge, and appreciate that individual and collaborative scientific endeavours are influenced by cultural perspectives and worldviews. In this sub-strand, students develop core concepts that: scientific inquiry values curiosity, creativity, precision, objectivity, open-mindedness, perseverance and scepticism scientific knowledge is a result of individual and collaborative efforts, and advances reflect historical and global contributions scientific knowledge is built on empirical evidence; however, all scientific knowledge can be changed in light of new or reinterpreted evidence. Use and influence of science Students explore how scientific knowledge and applications affect individuals and communities, including informing their decisions and identifying responses to contemporary issues. They learn that ethical, environmental and social implications must be taken into account when making decisions about science practices and applications. Students gain an appreciation for the ways in which science is influenced by the needs and priorities of society. In this sub-strand, students develop the core concepts that: scientific knowledge, practices and products are influenced by ethical, environmental, social and economic factors science, technology and engineering are interconnected \u2013 advances in one field can lead to advances in other fields scientific knowledge, balanced with ethical and social considerations, contributes to understanding complex contemporary issues and identifying responses. Science Understanding In this strand, students learn to select and integrate relevant scientific knowledge to explain and predict phenomena, and apply that knowledge to new situations. Scientific knowledge refers to facts, concepts, principles, laws, theories and models that have been established over time. The Science Understanding strand comprises the following 4 sub-strands. Biological sciences Students develop an understanding of living things, including animals, plants and microorganisms, and their interdependence and interactions within ecosystems. They explore life cycles, body systems, structural adaptations and behaviours; how these features aid survival; and how characteristics are inherited by one generation from the previous generation. They consider the interdependence of biological systems at a range of scales, and identify how these systems respond to change. In this sub-strand, students develop the core concepts that: living things have evolved on Earth over hundreds of millions of years; this continuous process has led to rich diversity the form and features of living things are related to the functions of their body systems biological systems are interdependent, and interact with each other and their environments. Chemical sciences Students develop an understanding of the composition and behaviour of substances. They describe substances in terms of their state, such as being a solid, liquid or gas; and they classify matter in terms of its composition, such as being an element, compound or mixture. They explore physical changes, such as changes of state, and investigate how new substances form during chemical reactions. Students recognise that all substances consist of atoms, and that atoms in substances rearrange and recombine during chemical reactions to form new substances. They explore chemical systems at a range of scales, from sub-atomic to macroscopic, to examine relationships between atoms, properties of substances and energy. In this sub-strand, students develop the core concepts that: the chemical and physical properties of substances are determined by their structure at a range of scales substances change and new substances are formed when atoms rearrange; these changes involve energy transfer and energy transformation. Earth and space sciences Students develop an understanding of Earth\u2019s dynamic structure and Earth\u2019s place in the universe. They learn to view Earth as part of a larger celestial system. They explore how changes on Earth such as day and night and the seasons relate to Earth\u2019s rotation and its revolution around the Sun. Students explore the interactions and interdependencies of the systems that constitute the Earth system: the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere. They appreciate that living things depend on sustainability of the Earth system, and investigate the influence of human activity on key processes, cycles and relationships. In this sub-strand, students develop the core concepts that: the Earth system comprises dynamic and interdependent systems; interactions between these systems cause continuous change over a range of scales all living things are connected through Earth\u2019s systems and depend on sustainability of the Earth system Earth is part of an astronomical system; interactions between Earth and celestial bodies influence the Earth system. Physical sciences Students develop an understanding of forces and motion, and matter and energy. They investigate how an object\u2019s motion is influenced by a range of forces, such as frictional, magnetic, gravitational and electrostatic forces, and learn how to represent and predict the effects of these forces on an object\u2019s motion. They develop an increasingly rich concept of energy and how energy transfer is associated with phenomena involving motion, heat, sound, light and electricity. They appreciate that concepts of force, motion, matter and energy apply to systems ranging in scale from the atomic scale to the scale of the universe itself. In this sub-strand, students develop the core concepts that: forces affect the motion and behaviour of objects energy can be transferred and transformed, and is conserved within systems. Science Inquiry This strand is concerned with investigating ideas, developing explanations, solving problems, drawing valid conclusions, evaluating claims and constructing evidence-based arguments. Students learn the essential practices of science, including identifying and posing questions; planning, conducting and evaluating investigations; processing, analysing and interpreting evidence; and communicating findings. Science investigations are activities in which ideas, predictions or hypotheses are tested and conclusions are drawn in response to a question or problem. They can involve a range of methodologies and activities including experimental testing, fieldwork, locating and using information sources, conducting surveys and interviews, investigating case studies, and using modelling and simulations. The approach taken will depend on the context and aims of the investigation. All scientific methodologies include empirical observation (observation of the world), systematic observation, replicable methods, provisional results (open to question and debate) and objectivity. The Science Inquiry strand comprises the following 5 sub-strands. Questioning and predicting Students learn to identify and construct questions, propose hypotheses and predict possible outcomes. Students appreciate the role of questions, predictions and hypotheses as critical and creative drivers of scientific inquiry. In this sub-strand, students develop the core concepts that: scientific inquiry involves making observations and predictions, asking questions, and constructing and testing explanations for natural and physical phenomena scientific inquiry may be done to describe a phenomenon, explore relationships, test a theory or model, or design solutions. Planning and conducting Students learn to make decisions about how to investigate or solve a problem and carry out an investigation, and generate and record data safely. They consider ethical and cultural issues and protocols associated with the generation or use of data, and recognise and manage risk and safety. Students appreciate the important considerations and practices involved in the design of scientific investigations. In this sub-strand, students develop the core concept that: scientific inquiries should be designed to systematically generate or collect valid and reliable primary and secondary data in safe, ethical and interculturally aware ways. Processing, modelling and analysing Students learn to analyse and represent data in meaningful and useful ways, and identify trends, patterns and relationships in data. Students engage in the key practices involved in generating scientific evidence. In this sub-strand, students develop the core concept that: mathematical thinking underpins the science practices of representing objects and events, analysing data and modelling relationships. Evaluating Students learn to consider the quality of available evidence by critically evaluating methods used to generate data and whether these produce data of sufficient validity to enable a meaningful conclusion. Students assess the merit or significance of a claim, proposition, explanation or argument with reference to that evidence. Students engage in the practices involved in refining and revising scientific ideas. In this sub-strand, students develop the core concept that: evaluating evidence enables development of explanations, decision-making and designed solutions. Communicating Students learn to convey information or ideas to others in ways appropriate to the purpose and audience. Students engage in the practices involved in effective and purposeful communication for a range of audiences. In this sub-strand, students develop the core concept that: critiquing and communicating science ideas effectively is critical to advancing science, and influencing environmental, social and economic futures.", "id": "chunk_1465"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards", "id": "chunk_1466"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards describe what students are typically able to understand and do, and they are the basis for reporting student achievement.", "id": "chunk_1467"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Science, students progress along a learning continuum that provides the first achievement standard at Level 2, and then at Levels 4, 6, 8 and 10.", "id": "chunk_1468"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Content descriptions", "id": "chunk_1469"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Science, content descriptions sequence and describe the knowledge, understanding and skills that teachers need to teach and students are expected to learn.

Learning in Science Integrating the strands In the practice of science, the 3 strands of Science (Science as a Human Endeavour, Science Understanding and Science Inquiry) are closely integrated \u2013 the work of scientists seeks to respond to and influence society\u2019s needs, reflects the nature and development of science, and is built around scientific inquiry. Students\u2019 experiences of science at school should mirror and connect to the multifaceted nature of science.", "id": "chunk_1471"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "To achieve this, the 3 strands of Science should be taught in an integrated way. The content descriptions of the 3 strands have been written so that at each level this integration is possible. The content of Science Understanding can inform students\u2019 understanding of everyday phenomena, as well as contemporary issues such as resource use, emerging technologies, climate change and protection of biodiversity. The importance of these areas of science can be emphasised through the content of Science as a Human Endeavour, and students can be encouraged to view historical and contemporary science critically through aspects of the Science Inquiry strand, for example by evaluating and communicating. To support teachers and students to make connections across the strands, sample inquiry questions are provided within each band overview. These optional inquiry questions can give students context and motivation as they develop their scientific knowledge, understanding and practices. An inquiry question might provide a useful prompt for a class discussion or a series of learning experiences. Key ideas An overarching set of key ideas supports teachers and students to make connections across the 3 strands of Science. Exploring the key ideas supports the coherence of scientific understanding within and across levels, enabling students to connect diverse phenomena and frame their deepening understanding in the context of systems thinking. Systems thinking also underpins scientific inquiry practices and contributes to developing students\u2019 appreciation of science. Six key ideas are important to integrating the 3 strands of Science. Patterns, order and organisation An important aspect of science is recognising patterns in the world around us, and ordering and considering phenomena at different scales. As students progress from Foundation to Level 10, they build skills and understanding that will help them to observe and describe patterns at different scales, and to develop and use classifications to organise events and phenomena, and make predictions. As students progress from Foundation to Level 6, they become more proficient at identifying and describing the relationships that underpin patterns, including cause and effect. Students increasingly recognise that scale has an important role in the observation of patterns \u2013 some patterns may only be evident at certain timescales and spatial scales. Form and function Many aspects of science are concerned with the relationships between form (the make-up of an aspect of an object or organism) and function (the way in which that aspect works). As students progress from Foundation to Level 10, they see that the functions of living and non-living things rely on their forms. Students\u2019 understanding of forms \u2013 such as the features of living things and the properties of various materials, and their related functions or uses \u2013 is initially based on observable behaviours and properties. From Level 3, students recognise that function often relies on form and that this relationship can be examined at many scales. They apply an understanding of microscopic and atomic structures, interactions of force, and flows of energy and matter to describe relationships between form and function. Stability and change Many areas of science involve the recognition, description and prediction of stability and change. From Foundation, students recognise that, in their observations of the world around them, some properties and phenomena appear to remain stable or constant over time, whereas others change. As they progress from Foundation to Level 10, they also recognise that phenomena (such as properties of objects and relationships between living things) can appear stable at one timescale or spatial scale, but may change at larger or smaller scales. Students begin to appreciate that stability can be the result of competing but balanced forces or processes. They become increasingly adept at quantifying change through measurement, and looking for patterns of change by representing and analysing data in tables or graphs. Scale and measurement Quantification of time and spatial scale is critical to the development of scientific understanding because it enables the comparison of observations. However, students often find it difficult to comprehend scales outside their everyday experience \u2013 these include the vast distances in space, the incredibly small size of atoms and the slow processes that occur over geological time. As students progress from Foundation to Level 10, their understanding of relative sizes and rates of change develops, and they conceptualise events and phenomena at a broader range of scales. They progress from working with scales related to their everyday experiences, comparing events and phenomena using relative language (such as \u2018bigger\u2019 or \u2018faster\u2019), and informal measurement, to working with scales beyond direct human experience, and quantifying magnitudes, rates of change and comparisons using formal units of measurement. Matter and energy Many aspects of science involve identifying, describing and measuring transfers of energy and matter. As students progress through the levels, they become increasingly able to explain phenomena in terms of the flow of matter and energy. From Foundation, students focus on direct experience and observation of phenomena and materials. From Level 3, they connect observable phenomena with ideas about particles, forces, and energy transfer and transformation that are more abstract. They use these understandings to describe and model phenomena and processes involving matter and energy. Systems Science often involves systems thinking, modelling and analysing to understand, explain and predict events and phenomena. As students progress from Foundation to Level 10, they explore, describe and analyse increasingly complex systems. Initially, students identify the observable components of a clearly identified \u2018whole\u2019, such as features of plants and animals and parts of mixtures. Across Levels 3 to 6, they learn to identify and describe relationships between components within simple systems, and they begin to appreciate that components within living and non-living systems are interdependent. At Levels 7 to 10, they are introduced to the processes and relationships that structure systems such as ecosystems, body systems and the carbon cycle. They recognise that, within systems, interactions between components can involve forces and changes acting in opposing directions. For a system to be in a steady state, these factors need to be in a state of balance or equilibrium. Students are increasingly aware that systems can exist as components within larger systems, and that one important part of thinking about systems is identifying boundaries, inputs and outputs. Key considerations Two key considerations are important to integrating the 3 strands of Science. Safety Identifying and managing risk in Science involves addressing the safe use of equipment and materials as well as safe behaviours in field, classroom and laboratory contexts. It covers all necessary aspects of health, safety and injury prevention, and the use of potentially dangerous materials and equipment. Science learning experiences may involve the use of potentially hazardous substances and hazardous equipment. It is the responsibility of the principal to ensure that duty of care is exercised in relation to the health and safety of all students, and that school practices comply with health and safety requirements. Teachers and students should observe appropriate safety precautions and cultural responsiveness when undertaking practical investigations, and all laboratory work should be supervised by the teacher. Schools should refer to the relevant Acts, regulations, codes and standards (see the support materials for specific references). Teachers should ensure they access up-to-date versions of all Acts, regulations, codes and standards. In Victoria, the relevant legislation for electrical safety is the Electricity Safety Act 1998 and associated regulations. Only persons who hold an appropriate current electrical licence are permitted to carry out electrical work on products or equipment that require voltages greater than 50 V AC or 120 V ripple-free DC. This requirement means that students are not permitted to carry out any electrical work on the internal components of electrical products or equipment that operate above these voltages. Students are permitted to work with approved apparatus, appliances and testing equipment that operate at voltages up to 240 V (e.g. appliances such as electric drills or electric soldering irons); however, they must not access or modify any component on such apparatus or appliances. Any product that requires voltages up to 50 V AC or 120 V DC in a supervised class must comply with \u2018Wiring rules\u2019 (AS/NZS 3000:2000) and the general requirements for electrical equipment in \u2018Approval and test specification\u2019 (AS/NZS 3100:2002). For investigations involving food, care must be taken with regard to food safety and specific food allergies, including food allergies that may result in anaphylactic reactions. The Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy has published guidelines for the prevention of anaphylaxis in schools. Allergen awareness training is available. For investigations involving animals, teachers should refer to the Victorian Department of Education Teaching with Animals policies, guidance and resources. Ethics Animal ethics Any teaching activities that involve caring for, using or interacting with animals must comply with the National Health and Medical Research Council\u2019s Australian Code for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes. In accordance with legislative requirements, every Victorian school using animals for scientific teaching and learning must be covered by a Scientific Procedures Premises Licence. A single licence held by the Victorian Department of Education covers all government schools. Catholic and independent schools must apply for individual licences, obtained through Agriculture Victoria. The Victorian Schools Animal Ethics Committee (VSAEC) assists Victorian schools to comply with relevant legislation in the responsible care of animals used in teaching. VSAEC is available to government, Catholic and independent schools. For further information about relevant guidelines, or to access your local animal ethics committee, see the Victorian Department of Education guidelines Care and Use of Animals in Victorian Schools. Ethical conduct of scientific investigations As part of Science, teachers and students may be involved in teaching and learning activities that involve practical work and scientific investigations using human subjects. Teachers and schools have a legal and moral responsibility to ensure that students always demonstrate ethical conduct when undertaking such activities. Teachers should refer to the support materials for links to detailed advice.", "id": "chunk_1472"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Curriculum", "id": "chunk_1473"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Foundation to Level 2 Band description", "id": "chunk_1474"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "From Foundation to Level 2, students build an understanding that science involves making and organising observations to identify patterns and relationships, and that these patterns and relationships are the basis of scientific predictions. A focus for students at these levels is on exploring changes in the world around them, including changes they can initiate themselves, such as making things move or change shape. They observe that changes to objects and events can be large or small and happen quickly or slowly. Their investigations of the properties of materials lead them to recognise that those properties stay the same when a material is changed physically. Students begin to link function with observable properties, such as comparing the features of animals and plants that enable them to survive. They identify the components of simple systems and explore the ways that components in a system interact. Students develop scientific skills by observing using their senses, posing questions and conducting investigations to seek answers to questions. They use counting and informal measurements to make comparisons. They appreciate that organising observations in tables makes it easier to identify and represent patterns, recognising that some patterns can only be observed over certain timescales. Inquiry questions can help stimulate students\u2019 curiosity and challenge their thinking. Following are examples of inquiry questions that could be used to prompt discussion and exploration of the key science ideas: Why is sorting important? How are a spider and a fly alike and different?

They explain how the features of plants and animals enable their survival. They describe the observable properties of the materials that make up objects. They provide examples of objects and mixtures that are made from a combination of materials, and distinguish between the properties of objects or mixtures and those of the materials from which they are made. They identify ways to change materials without changing their material composition. They identify daily and seasonal changes and describe ways these changes affect everyday life. They identify celestial objects and describe patterns they see in the sky. They suggest ways that the use of common materials can be reduced, re-used and recycled, and explain the importance of these actions for sustainability. They identify factors that influence the movement of objects. They describe and predict how different strengths and directions of pushes and pulls change the motion and shape of objects. They describe the effect of sound energy on objects and demonstrate how different sounds can be produced. Students pose questions about observed patterns or relationships and make predictions related to familiar objects and events. They suggest steps to be followed in an investigation, and follow safe procedures to make and record observations, including informal measurements.

Students explore the value of grouping and classifying objects and events based on similarities and differences, and begin to recognise that classifications are not always easy to define or apply. Investigations of different materials lead to a deeper understanding of the relationship between form and function, and an appreciation that classification can enable prediction. Students recognise that change is described and measured in terms of differences over time and they begin to quantify their observations to enable comparisons. Their explorations related to forces and energy allow them to appreciate that some interactions result from phenomena that cannot be seen with the unaided eye. They learn that key processes such as heat transfer can cause predictable changes in simple systems. They extend their understanding of systems as interactions between related components and analyse patterns to identify that these interactions can occur in predictable ways. Students learn more sophisticated ways of identifying and representing relationships, including the use of tables and graphs to identify patterns and relationships. They understand that science involves conducting fair tests to answer questions, test predictions or draw conclusions, and that scientific explanations are based on data. They recognise the value of using standard units of measurement to measure and compare the attributes of systems. Inquiry questions can help excite students\u2019 curiosity and challenge their thinking.

They recognise that the application of, or reference to, scientific knowledge has consequences and that it can be misused during public debate through the selective sharing of data or inferences. They explore factors that contribute to the broader adoption of scientific knowledge and practices by society. Various systems are studied at both macroscopic and microscopic levels, including how these systems respond to external changes in order to maintain stability. Students learn that matter can be rearranged through chemical change and that these changes play an important role in many systems. They are introduced to the concepts of conservation of matter and energy, and develop an understanding of the evolutionary feedback mechanisms that ensure the continuity of life. They extend their understanding of the relationship between form and function through investigations such as an exploration of the properties and uses of different types of mechanical waves or an explanation of radioactive decay. Students analyse and evaluate how models simulate the flow of energy and matter to explain and predict phenomena and events. They begin to consider how well a sample or model represents the phenomena under study. They learn that all models involve assumptions and approximations, and that this can limit the reliability of predictions based on those models. Students examine evidence for different theories. They understand that motion and forces are related by applying physical laws and can be modelled mathematically. They build on their understanding of atomic theory to investigate patterns and relationships within the periodic table. Students analyse and synthesise data from systems at various scales to develop evidence-based explanations for phenomena.

Students consider the legal, aesthetic and functional factors that inform the design processes. Design and Technologies engages students to create quality designed solutions for identified needs and opportunities across a range of technologies contexts. Students plan and produce designed solutions and manage projects independently, collaboratively and in teams, from conception to realisation. They apply design and systems thinking and design processes to investigate, generate, evaluate, iterate and improve design ideas, processes and solutions. They plan and produce designed solutions. They develop a sense of pride, satisfaction and enjoyment from their ability to design and produce innovative designed products, services and\u202fenvironments. Design and Technologies offers students opportunities for authentic learning challenges that foster curiosity, confidence, persistence, innovation, creativity, respect and cooperation. The study of Design and Technologies also offers learning experiences for young people that can be transferable to other contexts, including broader communities. Aims Design and Technologies aims to develop the knowledge, understanding and skills to ensure that, individually and collaboratively, students: develop awareness and confidence as critical users of technologies of designed solutions investigate, generate, iterate and analyse to determine ethical and innovative designed solutions for sustainable futures use design and systems thinking to generate design ideas and communicate these to a range of audiences produce designed solutions suitable for a range of technologies contexts by selecting and manipulating a range of tools, materials, systems and components competently and safely, and managing processes evaluate processes and designed solutions, and transfer and apply knowledge and skills to new situations understand the roles and responsibilities of people in design and technologies occupations and how these occupations contribute to society. Structure", "id": "chunk_1511"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The Design and Technologies curriculum comprises the 3 related strands of Technologies and Society, Technologies Contexts and Creating Designed Solutions. The Technologies Contexts and Creating Designed Solutions strands are further organised into sub-strands, as shown below. Technologies and Society The Technologies and Society strand focuses on how people use and develop technologies while taking into account ethical considerations such as legal, aesthetic and functional factors. It includes sustainability dimensions (economic, environmental and social), as well as the impact of technologies on individuals, families, communities (local, regional and global), the economy and the environment \u2013 now and into the future. Technologies Contexts The Technologies Contexts strand focuses on the characteristics and properties of technologies contexts, and how they can be used to create innovative designed solutions. This strand explores 4 particular contexts, organised into the following sub-strands. Engineering principles and systems This sub-strand focuses on how energy and forces (e.g. chemical, electromagnetic, electrostatic, frictional, gravitational and mechanical forces) can be used to produce and control light, sound, heat and movement in products and systems. Engineering provides opportunities for students to make sense of and integrate scientific and mathematical principles and concepts by applying engineering design processes and practical skills. This enables the design and production of ethical, including sustainable, engineered solutions. Students should have opportunities to understand how ethical, including sustainable, engineered products, services and environments can be designed and produced as some resources diminish and environments change. They should progressively develop knowledge and understanding of how forces and the properties of materials affect the behaviour and performance of designed engineering solutions. Food and fibre production Food and fibre are the human-produced or harvested resources used to sustain life. They are produced in managed environments such as farms, gardens and plantations or harvested from wild populations. Challenges for world food and fibre production include an increasing world population and an uncertain climate, and competition for resources such as land and water. These pose ethical challenges, for example in relation to economic, environmental and social sustainability. Students have opportunities to engage in these challenges by understanding the processes of food and fibre production, and by investigating innovative and ethical, including sustainable, ways of supplying agriculturally produced raw materials. They progressively develop knowledge and understanding about the managed systems that produce food and fibre by creating designed solutions. Food specialisations This sub-strand includes the application of nutrition principles (as described in Health and Physical Education) and knowledge about food, its systems and technologies, selection and preparation, and contemporary technology-related food issues. Community awareness of, and interest in, accessing quality nutritious food from ethical, including sustainable, food systems is increasing. Individuals and communities are becoming empowered to make informed food selections and preparation choices to meet their needs. Students have opportunities to appreciate the importance of having access to and eating a variety of foods, and to gain a sound understanding of nutrition principles. They develop an understanding of contemporary technology-related food issues, such as ensuring the supply and consumption of food that reflects ethical, including sustainable, practices, and the importance of skills in food preparation when making food decisions to support healthy eating. They progressively develop knowledge and understanding about food, food systems and technologies, and how to make informed and appropriate food preparation choices when experimenting with and preparing healthy food. The healthy eating recommendations from the Australian Dietary Guidelines, including the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Guide to Healthy Eating, should be followed when teaching about food. Materials and technologies specialisations This sub-strand focuses on a broad range of traditional, contemporary and emerging materials and specialist areas that typically involve extensive use of technologies. We depend on designed products, services and environments for communication, housing, employment, health care, recreation and transport; however, we face increasing ethical concerns, including about long-term sustainability. Students have opportunities to develop the confidence to make decisions about processes and solutions that are ethical, including sustainable processes and solutions. They can do this by learning about and working with materials, components and production processes. Students progressively develop knowledge and understanding of the characteristics and properties of a range of materials, either when investigating particular materials or through producing designed solutions for a technologies specialisation. Examples of these specialisations are advanced manufacturing, architecture, electronics, exhibition design, fashion design, graphic design, product design, service design (infrastructure, leisure, transport) and textiles design. Creating Designed Solutions The Creating Designed Solutions strand is based on design thinking, design processes, and production processes and skills. This strand reflects a process of design and would typically be addressed by identifying needs or opportunities, and may involve developing a design brief. Content is organised into 5 sub-strands. These are the skills that students use throughout a design project. If students have been taught content from these sub-strands in one technologies context, they do not need to be taught the same content again; they can apply their skills to another technologies context. Investigating and defining This sub-strand involves students analysing, exploring and investigating information, needs and opportunities. As creators and citizens, students critically reflect on the intention, purpose and operation of technologies and designed solutions. Analysing encourages students to examine values, and to question and review processes and systems. Students reflect on how decisions they make may have implications for individuals, society, and local, regional and global environments \u2013 now and in the future. They explore and investigate technologies, systems, products, services and environments as they consider needs and opportunities. They progressively develop effective investigation strategies and consider the contributions of technologies to their lives, and make judgements about them. Students develop design criteria in response to needs and opportunities, and may respond to or develop design briefs. Generating and designing This sub-strand involves students developing and communicating design ideas for a range of audiences. Students generate and iterate ideas, make choices, weigh up options, consider alternatives and document various design ideas and possibilities. They use critical and creative thinking strategies to generate, evaluate, critique and document ideas to meet needs or opportunities that have been identified by an individual, a group or a wider community. Generating creative ideas involves thinking differently; it entails proposing new approaches to existing solutions and identifying new design opportunities reflecting ethical, including sustainable, considerations. Generating and developing ideas involves identifying various competing factors that may influence and dictate the focus of the idea. Students use speculative thinking to imagine, explore and consider possibilities that may or may not exist or happen in the future. They engage in creative and hypothetical thought processes to speculate about different scenarios, outcomes or ideas that go beyond what is currently known or proven. They use speculative thinking to explore new perspectives, challenge existing assumptions and stimulate innovation. Speculative thinking is nurtured by asking thought-provoking \u2018what if\u2019 questions and embracing alternative possibilities. By doing so, students expand their understanding and knowledge, and use their imagination in new ways. Students evaluate, justify and synthesise what they learn and discover. They use graphical representation techniques when they sketch, draw, model, simulate and design ideas that focus on well-considered designed solutions. Students use physical representation techniques when they make models and prototypes. The use of modelling and prototyping to accurately develop simple and complex simulated or physical models supports the production of successful designed solutions. Prototypes allow designers to identify and address potential issues, and to make necessary improvements before moving to the final production stage. Therefore, making prototypes is an integral part of the design process, allowing designers to validate their ideas, gather feedback, and refine their designs for better performance and end-user experience. Producing and implementing This sub-strand involves students learning and applying a variety of skills and techniques to make designed solutions to meet specific purposes and end-user needs. Students apply knowledge about components and materials, and their characteristics and properties, to ensure these are suitable for use. They learn about the importance of adopting safe work practices. They develop accurate production skills to achieve quality designed solutions. Students develop the capacity to select and use appropriate tools, processes, materials, systems and components; and use work practices that respect ethical, including sustainable, considerations. Evaluating This sub-strand involves students reviewing design ideas, processes and solutions. Evaluating occurs throughout a design process. Students seek feedback and make judgements throughout a design process, including about the quality and effectiveness of their and others\u2019 designed solutions. Students identify design criteria for needs or opportunities in the investigating and defining stage and then use these criteria to consider the implications and consequences of actions and decision-making throughout the remainder of the process. They determine effective ways to test, judge, critique and improve their ideas, concepts and designed solutions. They reflect on processes and transfer their learning to other design needs or opportunities. Planning and managing This sub-strand involves students learning to work cooperatively, and to manage time and other resources, to effectively create designed solutions. Planning and managing occur throughout a design process. Progressively, students develop the ability to communicate and share ideas throughout the design process, negotiate roles and responsibilities and make compromises to work collaboratively as well as effectively as a team. Students work individually and in groups to plan, organise and monitor timelines, activities and the use of resources. They progress from planning steps in a project through to more complex project management activities that require them to co-design and co-develop. They also need to consider factors such as time, cost, risk assessment, and management and quality control.", "id": "chunk_1512"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards", "id": "chunk_1513"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards describe what students are typically able to understand and do, and they are the basis for reporting student achievement.", "id": "chunk_1514"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Design and Technologies, students progress along a learning continuum that provides the first achievement standard at Level 2, and then subsequent achievement standards at Levels 4, 6, 8 and 10.", "id": "chunk_1515"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Content descriptions", "id": "chunk_1516"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Design and Technologies, content descriptions sequence and describe the knowledge, understanding and skills that teachers need to teach and students are expected to learn.

They are provided as advisory material only. Learning in Design and Technologies In Design and Technologies, students are actively engaged in the processes of creating designed solutions for personal, local, regional and global settings for sustainable futures. For younger children, this usually involves personal and family settings, where there is an immediate, direct and tangible outcome, and where play and practical exploration are focuses. Students work on projects as they investigate needs and opportunities; generate and evaluate ideas; and plan, manage, produce and evaluate designed solutions. They evaluate throughout the process of engaging with a design process by using predetermined design criteria that have been provided or negotiated with the class, or developed by students. Integrating the strands", "id": "chunk_1518"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Teaching and learning programs typically integrate content from each strand. By the end of each band, students have had opportunities to create different types of designed solutions that address all 4 sub-strands of Technologies Contexts. For example, a teaching and learning unit in Design and Technologies may integrate content descriptions from the Technologies and Society and Creating Designed Solutions strands, and at least one sub-strand from Technologies Contexts, or it may address several sub-strands from the Technologies Contexts strand and include a design brief. The combination of contexts and types of designed solutions is a school decision. Design brief A design brief is a concise statement clarifying a project task and defining the need to be addressed or opportunity to be explored, and enabling a broad range of possible responses. After some investigation and research analysis, a design brief typically identifies intended end users, design criteria, constraints, available resources and a timeframe for the project. A design brief may also include possible consequences and impacts. A design brief is a tool for clarifying a problem or, when a design brief is externally imposed, a guideline for design. In the earlier levels of learning, design briefs may be fairly prescriptive and teacher directed. As design skills and design thinking develop, students have greater input into the development of design briefs for specific, identified needs or opportunities. Factors influencing design decisions In Design and Technologies, students apply knowledge, practical skills and processes when using technologies and other resources to create innovative solutions to meet current and future needs. In doing so, they consider ethical factors including economic, environmental and social sustainability. At each band, students begin by considering environmental dimensions, then environmental and social dimensions, and, finally, broader ethical considerations including environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainability. Students make ethical decisions about the practice and use of design and technologies, considering legal (e.g. intellectual property), health and sustainability implications, as well as aesthetic and functional requirements. They also consider the suitability of enterprise and marketing for the designed solution. Progression of production skills Students spend a substantial amount of time engaged in developing production processes and skills. Through the practical application of technologies, students develop fine motor skills, which include dexterity and coordination, through experiential activities. The overall quality of their solutions (e.g. quality of finishes and complexity of the design tasks) improves as their production skills improve. Students produce designed solutions using production processes involving natural and fabricated materials, components and digital tools. The types of technology they use may become progressively more sophisticated. As students engage in the process of generating, developing and communicating their ideas to diverse audiences within various technologies contexts, they acquire more skill in using drawings as a means of graphical representation including both rendered drawings and rendered views. Students may use manual and digital tools to progress from producing concept sketches or basic drawings to three-dimensional (3D) drawings. They also develop physical representation skills when the focus of the design project is on producing a designed solution. Physical representations show how an actual or virtual product will look and work, to inform the production of the designed solutions. Students progress from basic modelling and prototyping to producing sophisticated models and prototypes using manual and digital tools. They use technical terms and techniques when developing both graphical and physical representations. Planning and managing projects In Design and Technologies, students are actively involved in projects. At earlier levels, students plan, with teacher support, simple steps and follow directions to complete their own projects or manage their roles within team projects. As students progress through primary school, they take more responsibility for specific roles within a project, with increasing collaboration and teamwork. Students develop project plans to outline the tasks and steps required to make a designed solution. At Levels 7 and 8, students begin to manage projects that involve co-designing and co-developing solutions, with support from peers and teachers. At Levels 9 and 10, students use their increasing skills to fully manage projects and teams when co-designing and co-developing. They develop more comprehensive project management plans, which detail management of an entire project. They use both manual and digital tools to support their project management. They coordinate teams and collaborate with others locally, regionally and globally. Design thinking Design thinking involves the use of strategies for understanding design needs and opportunities; visualising and generating creative ideas; planning; and analysing, evaluating and critiquing the ideas that best meet the design criteria. Design thinking includes the act of working creatively, critically and speculatively, and uses both divergent and convergent thinking strategies. Divergent and convergent thinking are essential in fostering both critical and creative thinking processes, supporting the development of innovative and well-reasoned solutions. These types of thinking provide opportunities to extend students\u2019 understanding and application of the Critical and Creative Thinking capability. Creative thinking is where ideation occurs. Creative thinking stimulates the broadening of ideas that are imaginative and unique, and this aligns with divergent thinking aspects of a design process. Students progress from simple to more complex creative thinking skills. In the earlier levels, students explore simple and straightforward ideas, allowing their imagination to grow and develop. As they advance, their creative thinking becomes more sophisticated, encompassing a wider range of ideas. They learn to think divergently, investigating different possibilities and considering many perspectives to generate innovative and unique solutions. Critical thinking involves the process of evaluating, reasoning and comparing information. It includes conducting research, performing tests and refining ideas. This aligns with the convergent aspects of a design process. As students advance, they move from exploring ideas to analysing, evaluating and critiquing design concepts and solutions. Speculative thinking involves the use of critical and creative thinking to synthesise information, and to consider the appropriateness and usefulness of a range of ideas or suggestions, with a focus on the future. At Levels 5 and 6, students begin to hypothesise, propose and recommend ideas and suggestions, based on research of their selected technologies, that contribute positively to sustainability and worldviews. Students progress to more sophisticated and nuanced speculative thinking in the later levels. They engage in deeper research, analyse information, and consider the ethical consequences of their design and production decisions as they progress. This includes a focus on ethical consequences of designing and making, including environmental, social, economic and worldview considerations. Design thinking underpins learning in Design and Technologies. Design processes require students to identify and investigate a need or an opportunity; generate, plan, manage and create designed solutions; and evaluate products and processes. Ethical considerations, which include economic, environmental and social impacts that result from designed solutions, are core to design thinking, design processes and Design and Technologies. Safety Identifying and managing risk in Design and Technologies involves addressing the safe use of technologies, as well as risks that can affect project timelines. Technologies covers all the necessary aspects of health and safety, and injury prevention, as well as (in any technologies context) the use of potentially dangerous materials and tools. Technologies includes ergonomic considerations and \u2013 when communicating and collaborating online \u2013 safety (e.g. cyber safety and data security) and ethics (e.g. legal considerations). Technologies learning experiences may involve the use of potentially hazardous substances and/or hazardous tools. It is the responsibility of schools to ensure that a duty of care is exercised in relation to the health and safety of all students, and that school practices meet the requirements of Victoria\u2019s\u00a0Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 and\u00a0Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014, and the Commonwealth\u2019s Work Health and Safety Act 2011. In implementing projects with a focus on food, care must be taken with regard to food safety and specific food allergies, including food allergies that may result in anaphylactic reactions. The Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy has published\u00a0guidelines for prevention of anaphylaxis in schools, preschools and childcare. For information specific to Victorian government schools, see the Victorian Department of Education policy on allergies. Ethics Animal ethics Any teaching activities that involve caring for, using or interacting with animals must comply with the National Health and Medical Research Council\u2019s Australian Code for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes. In accordance with legislative requirements, every Victorian school using animals for scientific teaching and learning must be covered by a Scientific Procedures Premises Licence. A single licence held by the Victorian Department of Education covers all government schools. Catholic and independent schools must apply for individual licences, obtained through Agriculture Victoria. The Victorian Schools Animal Ethics Committee (VSAEC) assists Victorian schools to comply with relevant legislation in the responsible care of animals used in teaching. VSAEC is available to government, Catholic and independent schools. For further information about relevant guidelines, or to access your local animal ethics committee, see the Victorian Department of Education guidelines Care and Use of Animals in Victorian Schools.", "id": "chunk_1519"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Curriculum connections", "id": "chunk_1520"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Design and Technologies\u00a0has strong connections with several learning areas within the Victorian Curriculum. Design Design thinking and design processes feature significantly in Design and Technologies, Digital Technologies and the Arts. Design thinking and design processes are also examples of critical, creative and speculative thinking. The Creating Designed Solutions strand in Design and Technologies develops design thinking and design processes. Designing in Design and Technologies involves design thinking and the explicit use of design processes to create designed solutions for an identified end user and purpose (usually to fulfil some wider practical purpose). Designing involves developing designed solutions that consider a range of ethical factors (e.g. sustainability) and functionality related to the identified need or opportunity and that can be evaluated using identified design criteria. Designing involves experimenting with technologies through drawing, modelling and the manipulation of materials. Food and nutrition", "id": "chunk_1521"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Student attitudes and behaviour regarding healthy living can be influenced by providing students with opportunities to learn about where their food comes from, how it is produced and how they can prepare it. In the Victorian Curriculum F\u201310, students are taught about food and nutrition in Health and Physical Education and in Design and Technologies. In Health and Physical Education, students develop knowledge and understanding of nutrition principles to enable them to develop positive food behaviours and consider the range of influences on these behaviours. In Design and Technologies, students learn how to apply knowledge of the sensory and functional properties of food, along with the nutrition principles described in Health and Physical Education, to select and prepare food. They do this through the design and preparation of food for specific purposes and consumers. They also develop understandings of contemporary technology-related food issues considering ethical factors, including sustainability, in food systems. They explore issues such as food security within Australia, food wastage, food packaging, ultra-processed foods and food transport. It is important that the premise of healthy eating, which underpins the teaching of food and nutrition, does not target individual choices or behaviours. It is equally important to provide information about food in a positive and non-judgemental way, avoiding phrases like \u2018good versus bad\u2019 or \u2018healthy versus unhealthy\u2019 foods. Additionally, it is essential to avoid promoting a narrow view of food choices considered to be appropriate, and to use non-stigmatising language to foster healthy attitudes and behaviours towards food and nutrition. This includes avoiding associating food with weight gain or loss. Refer to the Victorian Department of Education Healthy Eating and Canteens and Other Food Services policy for further information about healthy eating.

A deep knowledge and understanding of information systems enables students to be safe, respectful, creative and discerning decision-makers when they select, use and manage data, information, processes and digital systems to meet needs and shape preferred futures. Digital Technologies provides students with practical opportunities to use design thinking and to be innovative developers of digital solutions within an ethical framework, considering Safety by Design principles. Digital Technologies can also have an important role in responding to the diversity of learners and in ensuring the participation of all students in the learning process. The study of Digital Technologies helps students to become innovative creators of digital solutions, effective users of digital systems and critical consumers of information conveyed by digital systems. Digital Technologies gives students authentic learning challenges that foster curiosity, confidence, persistence, innovation, creativity, respect and cooperation. These are all necessary when using and developing information systems to make sense of complex ideas and relationships in all areas of learning. Digital Technologies helps students to be innovative learners who are active, ethical citizens capable of being informed members of the community.", "id": "chunk_1566"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "The Digital Technologies curriculum has been designed to provide practical and authentic opportunities for students to explore the capacity of information systems to systematically and innovatively transform data into digital solutions through the application of computational, design and systems thinking. Aims Digital Technologies aims to develop the knowledge, understanding and skills to ensure that, individually and collaboratively, students: use computational thinking (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, modelling and algorithms) to create digital solutions use design thinking to design, create, manage and evaluate sustainable and innovative digital solutions to meet and redefine current and future needs apply systems thinking to monitor, analyse, predict and shape the interactions within and between information systems and the impact of these systems on individuals, societies, economies and environments confidently and responsibly use digital systems to efficiently and effectively automate the transformation of data into information and to creatively communicate ideas in a range of settings apply protocols and legal practices that support the ethical collection and generation of data through automated and non-automated processes, and participate in safe and respectful communications and collaboration with audiences. Structure Digital Technologies comprises 3 related strands: Digital Systems and Security Data, Information and Privacy Creating Digital Solutions. Digital Systems and Security The Digital Systems and Security strand focuses on the components of digital systems: hardware, software and networks. In Foundation to Level 2, students learn about a range of hardware and software and progress to an understanding of how data is transmitted between components within a system, and how the hardware and software interact to form secure access to data in networks. Students learn the importance of effective security protocols. They effectively access school or personal accounts. Students progress from using simple usernames and passwords in Foundation to Level 2 to using unique passphrases, multi-factor authentication and considering cyber security threats. Data, Information and Privacy The Data, Information and Privacy strand focuses on how data is represented and structured symbolically for use by digital systems. Students explore the properties of data, including types of data, and how data is acquired and interpreted using a range of digital systems and peripherals, and they analyse data when creating information. They progress from exploring data acquisition strategies and looking for patterns to validating the data and data integrity. Students develop the ability to create, locate, communicate and share ideas and content. They negotiate roles and responsibilities and interact safely using appropriate information system protocols and agreed behaviours to independently and collaboratively manage projects to create interactive solutions. Students are progressively guided by trusted adults to account for risks when working individually and collaboratively. Students develop appropriate techniques for managing personal data, and effectively implement security protocols. They investigate how online applications and networked systems curate their data, and explore strategies to manage their digital footprint and consider privacy. Creating Digital Solutions The Creating Digital Solutions strand focuses on the interrelated processes and associated skills by which students create digital solutions to solve problems and meet needs. Students define problems by identifying appropriate needs and requirements. These define and communicate a problem precisely and clearly as an important part of specification. Students create algorithms that clearly define steps that may lead to creating a digital solution. They progressively move from following algorithms in their daily activities to designing algorithms and validating these against test cases. Students make choices, weigh up options and consider alternatives. When designing, students consider how users will interact with the solutions, and check and validate their designs to increase the likelihood of creating working solutions. Students identify errors that may occur within an algorithm and how control structures can improve the flow through a program. Students use critical and creative thinking strategies to generate, evaluate and document design ideas to meet needs or opportunities that have been identified by an individual, a group or a wider community. They use modelling and prototyping to accurately develop simple and complex models that support the production of successful digital solutions. Students consider the implications and consequences of actions and decision-making. Students implement their algorithms as a program through digital systems to solve problems and meet specific user needs. Students develop the capacity to select and use appropriate digital tools and equipment, and use techniques that respect the need for sustainability. They determine effective ways to test their digital solutions. Students evaluate the design process, and the quality and effectiveness of their digital solutions.", "id": "chunk_1567"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards", "id": "chunk_1568"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Achievement standards describe what students are typically able to understand and do, and they are the basis for reporting student achievement.", "id": "chunk_1569"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Digital Technologies, students progress along a learning continuum that provides the first achievement standard at Level 2, and then at Levels 4, 6, 8 and 10.", "id": "chunk_1570"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Content descriptions", "id": "chunk_1571"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "In Digital Technologies, content descriptions sequence and describe the knowledge, understanding and skills that teachers need to teach and students are expected to learn.

Learning in Digital Technologies In Digital Technologies, students are actively engaged in the interrelated problem-solving processes of analysing problems, needs and opportunities; designing, implementing (developing) and evaluating digital solutions; and creating and sharing information that meets a range of current and future needs. Students learn to safely and ethically use the capacity of information systems to create digital solutions. These solutions and information are created through the application of computational, design and systems thinking skills. Key concepts", "id": "chunk_1573"}, {"type": "Chunk", "text": "Underpinning the learning in the Digital Technologies curriculum are the key concepts (outlined below) that establish ways of thinking about solving problems, looking for opportunities for enterprise and looking at the impact of solutions. The key concepts of abstraction, data acquisition, representation and interpretation, specification, algorithms and implementation are included within the key elements of computational thinking. Collectively these concepts span the key ideas about the organisation, representation and automation of digital solutions and information. The concepts can be explored in digital or non-digital contexts and are likely to underpin the future impact of digital systems and provide a language and perspective that students and teachers can use when discussing Digital Technologies. Safety When students are problem-solving, and creating and communicating information, they will apply skills using common conventions and following agreed behaviours to meet their legal, safety, cultural and ethical obligations and responsibilities. For example, conventions such as using acceptable language, acknowledging different cultural practices, and using passwords and privacy settings on social media sites are applied to increase the security of personal data and to respect partnerships in online communities. Identifying and managing risk in Digital Technologies involves addressing the safe use of digital tools as well as risks that can affect project timelines. It covers all necessary aspects of health, safety and injury prevention and, in any Digital Technologies situation, the use of potentially dangerous materials, tools and equipment. It includes ergonomics, online safety, and ethical and legal considerations when communicating and collaborating online. When planning to incorporate immersive technologies \u2013 augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality or extended reality \u2013 in learning experiences, teachers should consider the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines as well as other issues including the physical, cognitive, linguistic, emotional, social and moral developmental stage of learners. See explicit advice on the risks of immersive technologies use in the eSafety Commissioner's position statement. The use of drones (remotely piloted aircraft) or model aircraft for educational purposes at education institutions is considered \u2018flying for fun\u2019 under Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) guidelines; however, teachers should also consider their relevant education sector\u2019s governance standards. The CASA \u2018Drones at school\u2019 information lists requirements and tips for teachers and educators on issues such as health, safety and privacy for any drone operation. See the Victorian Department of Education guidance on drones in schools for further and more detailed advice. Privacy and security Identifying and managing the implications of and concerns related to the collection and generation of data through automated and non-automated processes addresses the risks that can affect secure engagement with digital systems. Privacy includes recognising the risks that are faced online and the mitigation strategies involved in managing them. In Australia, guidance on best practice for privacy is informed by the Australian Privacy Principles, the cornerstone of the privacy protection framework in the Privacy Act 1988. In Victoria, guidance on how Victorian public sector organisations must handle personal information is informed by the Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014. For more information, see the Office of the Victorian Information Commissioner. Security covers the development of appropriate technical, social, cognitive, communicative and decision-making skills to address online and network security risks. It includes data security, and ethical and legal considerations when working with and designing digital systems. When engaging with and designing digital systems, identifying and managing security threats and mitigation in a data-intensive world are paramount. In Australia, guidance on best practice for cyber security is informed by the Australian Signals Directorate. This Australian Government organisation provides strategic guidance on how individuals and organisations can protect their systems and data from cyber threats.

For more information about relevant guidelines for safety, cyber security, copyright and intellectual property, teachers should contact their Victorian education sector authorities. Designing for safety and equity Students have opportunities in Digital Technologies to apply Safety by Design principles and universal design principles when designing solutions. Safety by Design focuses on the ways designers of digital solutions can minimise online threats by anticipating, detecting and eliminating online harms before they occur. This proactive and preventive approach focuses on embedding safety into the culture of the design process. It emphasises accountability and aims to foster more positive, civil and rewarding online experiences for everyone. More information is available from the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, including the eSafety Toolkit for Schools and the Safety by Design vision for young people. The 8 Goals of Universal Design were developed to guide the design of environments, products and communications. The universal design principles provide an opportunity to create solutions that respond to the changing circumstances of people and to changes in technologies. When students apply the principles, they create products that change and adapt for everyone. In Digital Technologies, the 8 goals may be applied to evaluate existing designed and digital solutions, guide students through the design process and provide them with guidance on the characteristics that support products, services and environments so they are more accessible and usable by consumers. Integrating the strands Students draw on the content of the Digital Systems and Security, and Data, Information and Privacy strands when applying processes and technical skills pertaining to the Creating Digital Solutions strand.
